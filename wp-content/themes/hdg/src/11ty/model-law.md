#### Part B1: Housekeeping provisions of the model law  

### **Section 1: Purpose** 

The intention of this section is to articulate the foundational principles and objectives of the model law. These foundational principles and objectives, and implementation guidance below, can be considered and applied widely when strengthening the national legislative landscape dealing with the governance of health data, whether those entail updating current laws or developing new ones. These are foundational principles and objectives are therefore not limited to countries developing a whole new health data governance law. 

#### **Rationale**

*Recognition of the special nature of health data*

The distinct characteristics of health data are acknowledged, which have far-reaching implications for individual privacy, community identity, and the advancement of healthcare research and innovation. The law recognizes that health data is not just another category of personal data; it is deeply intertwined with individuals’ personal and medical histories, cultural practices, and collective well-being.

Understanding the special nature of health data is essential for crafting a legal framework that adequately protects the rights of individuals and communities while promoting the beneficial use of health data for research and innovation. This recognition lays the groundwork for the specific protections and governance structures established by the model law.

*Augmentation of existing data protection law*

This provision emphasizes that the model law is designed to supplement existing data protection laws by addressing the unique aspects of health data. While general data protection laws provide a broad framework for safeguarding personal data, they may not fully capture the complexities and sensitivities associated with health data.

By augmenting existing data protection laws, the model law ensures that the specific needs and challenges of health data governance are addressed. This includes balancing the interests of individual data subjects, communities, and the health research community in a way that promotes both privacy and innovation.

*Specific aims of the model law*

The specific aims of the model law are to establish effective governance structures for health data processing, safeguard individual privacy rights, protect community interests in health data, and foster a conducive environment for health research and innovation. Additionally, the law aims to manage non-identifying government-generated health data as a public good, facilitate health data sharing in the public interest, and provide a flexible legal framework that can adapt to future technological advancements in health data collection, analysis, and use. These aims collectively ensure that health data is governed in a manner that balances privacy, community rights, and the need for innovation in healthcare.

**International considerations**

The purpose of this law is closely tied to several international regulations, guidelines, treaties, and agreements. These include pandemic preparedness frameworks (e.g., IHR, PIP Framework), data protection frameworks (e.g., GDPR, OECD Guidelines), human rights principles (e.g., UDHR, ICCPR), intellectual property treaties (e.g., TRIPS), and global health initiatives (e.g., WHO, GHSA). Aligning the foundational principles and objectives of the law with these international frameworks ensures that the law is globally relevant, supports public health and pandemic preparedness, and protects individual privacy and proprietary rights in health data.

#### **Implementation tips**

This section sets out the ideological position underlying the model law. Care should be taken that this approach is not contrary to the objectives of other laws or policies.


### **Section 2: Definitions** 

This section provides the definitions of key terms used throughout the model law. 

#### **Rationale**

By clearly defining these terms, the section ensures consistency and clarity in the interpretation and application of the law. The definitions are carefully crafted to reflect the specific context and needs of health data governance, acknowledging the unique characteristics of health data, the roles of various stakeholders, and the importance of protecting both individual and community rights while promoting public health and innovation.

The definitions in this section are designed to align with existing legal frameworks, such as the existing data protection legislation, while extending these concepts to address the specific needs of health data governance. For example, the definition of “consent” is aligned with the existing data protection legislation but expanded to include community consent as contemplated in section 9 of the model law.

Some of the definitions are discussed in more detail in the sections where they are used. 

#### **International considerations**

This section is influenced by a variety of international regulations, treaties, guidelines, and agreements, particularly those related to health data protection (e.g., GDPR), public health emergencies (e.g., IHR, PIP Framework), intellectual property (e.g., TRIPS), and cross-border data transfers. Aligning key definitions with these international frameworks ensures that the law is applied consistently, avoids conflicts with existing global standards, and supports effective data governance in both domestic and international contexts.

#### **Implementation tips**

It is possible that some of the terms set out in this section will already have been defined elsewhere, particularly in an existing data protection law or in a national health law. For instance, it is highly likely that the definition of “consent” will already exist in national law and so care should be taken to identify and harmonise these definitions in the light of existing laws.

Refer to page 4 of the model law to see the various sources that were used to develop and refine the definitions. 

### **Section 3: Scope** 

The scope section of the model law delineates the extent and boundaries of the law’s applicability. By specifying who and what is covered under the law, this section ensures that all relevant individuals, entities, and types of data are included in the legal framework, thereby providing comprehensive governance over health data. The section covers a wide range of activities related to health data, from collection to disposal, and applies to both digital and non-digital formats, ensuring that the law remains relevant in various contexts and mediums.

#### **Rationale**

This provision specifies that the law covers both health data and health-related data. 

Health data can be categorised in two ways, which may overlap:

* First, whether it is ‘personal health data’ or ‘non-identifying health data’.   
* Second, whether it is ‘community health data’ or not. Community health data may or may not include personal health data, depending on whether it can be used to identify individual community members. 

Health-relevant data includes lifestyle data (e.g., fitness tracker data), social determinants of health (e.g., socioeconomic status), and environmental data (e.g., pollution levels).

Aligned with the purpose of augmenting existing data protection legislation, the objects that the model law aims to govern—health data and health-relevant data—are on the one hand more specific than the typical ambit of data protection legislation, as they relate specifically to *health*, but on the other hand also broader, as they are not limited to *personal* data. 

The main reason for the broad scope of “health data” is to include not only personal health data but also non-identifying health data is to recognise that not only personal health data, but also non-identifying health data has value and should, for the sake of comprehensiveness be included in the model law. In particular to ensure that proprietary rights in health data extends to non-identifying health data, create a positive duty on the state to provide access to non-identifying health data, and provide for the right to request access to all types of health data including non-identifying health data.  

#### **Other options of formulating the section**

*Tiered application based on data sensitivity and processing scale*

The law could adopt a tiered or risk-based approach, where different levels of regulation apply depending on the sensitivity of the data and the scale of the processing activity. For example, highly sensitive data like genetic information might be subject to stricter controls, while less sensitive data could be governed by more flexible rules. However, implementing a tiered system could add complexity to the law, making it more difficult for entities to understand their obligations. Clear guidelines and support from the Regulator would be necessary to ensure that stakeholders can navigate the different tiers effectively.

*Provisions for retrospective application*

The scope could include provisions for the retrospective application of certain aspects of the law, requiring entities to bring existing data practices into compliance within a specified timeframe. Retrospective application ensures that all health data, not just newly collected data, is governed by the standards set out in the law. This is particularly important for ensuring that historical data, which may still be sensitive or valuable, is protected under the new legal framework. Retrospective application could place a significant burden on entities that need to audit and potentially re-process existing data to meet new standards. Providing a reasonable compliance window and support from the Regulator could help mitigate these challenges.

#### **International considerations**

The scope of this law, which covers both personal and non-identifying health data as well as health-related data, is influenced by a range of international regulations, guidelines, treaties, and agreements. These include data protection laws (e.g., GDPR), public health regulations (e.g., IHR), intellectual property treaties (e.g., TRIPS), environmental health guidelines (e.g., WHO, UNEP), and global health security frameworks (e.g., GHSA). Aligning the scope of the model law with these international frameworks ensures that it effectively governs health data in a way that supports both individual privacy rights and public health goals, while remaining compliant with global legal standards.

#### **Implementation tips**

It is likely that this model law will overlap with the existing data protection law and (unexpected) conflict between the laws is dealt with in the interpretation (section 5\) below. Despite this, it is obviously better to amend the existing data protection law to be consistent with this model law where the conflicts between the two are known. 

### **Section 4: Exclusions** 

The exclusions section of the model law outlines specific circumstances where the law does not apply. By delineating these exclusions, the law acknowledges situations where the governance of health data might either be inappropriate or already adequately covered by other legal frameworks. This section helps to ensure that the law is focused on relevant activities and does not overextend into areas where its application could be unnecessary or counterproductive.

#### **Rationale**

*Personal or household activities*

This exclusion applies to health data collected, processed, stored, or used for personal or household activities with no connection to a public or professional context. Examples might include an individual tracking their own health metrics through a fitness app or maintaining personal medical records at home.

The purpose of this exclusion is to prevent the over-regulation of private activities that do not impact public health or involve any professional or commercial use of health data. Applying the law to personal or household activities would be overly intrusive and would unnecessarily burden individuals with compliance requirements intended for more formal data handling contexts.

*Non-health-related personal data*

This exclusion makes it clear that the model law does not apply to personal data that is not classified as health data or health-related data. For instance, personal information such as name, address, or financial information that does not pertain to health or is not used to infer health-related information would fall outside the scope of this law.

By excluding non-health-related personal data, the law maintains a focused scope that specifically addresses the unique challenges and sensitivities associated with health data. This ensures that the legal framework is not diluted by extending its reach to personal data that does not require the specialized protections provided by this law.

*Public body exemptions for specific purposes*

This exclusion allows health data to be exempted from the provisions of the law when required by a public body for purposes such as identifying and financing terrorist activities, money laundering, defence, or public safety. However, any such exemption must be approved by the Regulator, and it must be clearly defined, necessary, proportionate, and justified.

National security and public safety are critical concerns that sometimes necessitate the use of health data in ways that may not align with the protections established in this law. This exclusion allows for necessary flexibility while ensuring that exemptions are carefully controlled and only granted when absolutely necessary. The requirement for Regulatory approval ensures that there is oversight and that the use of such exemptions is justified and transparent.

*Journalistic, literary, or artistic expression*

This exclusion pertains to the use of health data within the realms of journalistic, literary, or artistic expression. For example, a journalist reporting on a public health issue or an artist creating a work that explores medical themes would not be subject to the constraints of the law.

Freedom of expression is a fundamental right, and this exclusion protects this right by ensuring that the law does not unduly restrict journalistic, literary, or artistic activities. These activities often serve the public interest by informing, educating, or challenging societal norms, and they should not be hampered by the legal constraints that apply to more formal uses of health data.

*Judicial functions of a court*

This exclusion clarifies that the model law does not apply to the judicial functions of a court. This means that health data used in court proceedings or related to judicial decision-making processes is not governed by this law.

The judicial process operates under its own set of rules and protections, designed to ensure fairness and justice. By excluding judicial functions from the scope of the law, this provision ensures that the courts can operate without interference from external legal requirements that might complicate or hinder the judicial process.

#### **Other options of formulating the section**

*Conditional exemptions with oversight*

Instead of outright exclusions, the law could introduce conditional exemptions where certain activities are exempted from the law’s provisions but only under specific conditions and with ongoing oversight by the Regulator or another appointed body. Conditional exemptions would allow for flexibility while still ensuring that exempted activities are monitored and that any potential risks are managed. This approach could be particularly relevant for activities related to national security or public safety, where ongoing oversight could help prevent abuse of the exemption. While providing flexibility, conditional exemptions could increase the complexity of the law and create additional administrative burdens for both the Regulator and the entities seeking exemptions. Clear guidelines and streamlined processes would be necessary to manage these challenges effectively. Conditional exemptions can also be applied for a limited time for the purposes of managing a health emergency. 

*Narrowing the scope of exemptions*

The law could narrow the scope of certain exemptions, particularly those related to national security and public safety, to ensure that only the minimum necessary data is exempted and that any exemptions are subject to strict limitations. Narrowing the scope of exemptions helps to protect individual and community rights by ensuring that exemptions are not overly broad or misused. This approach would reinforce the law’s commitment to data protection while still allowing for necessary flexibility in exceptional cases. Narrowing exemptions could limit the ability of public bodies to access health data in urgent situations, potentially hindering efforts to address national security threats or public safety concerns. A balance would need to be struck between protecting privacy and ensuring public safety.

#### **Implementation tips**

All exclusions within this section must be aligned with existing data protection law or health law. If this model law is used to amend an existing data protection law, then the exclusion in section 4(1)(b) should be omitted. 

#### **International considerations**

The International Health Regulations (IHR) and the Pandemic Influenza Preparedness (PIP) Framework govern international sharing of health data during pandemics and public health emergencies. These frameworks emphasise the need for rapid data sharing to support global responses. The law might exclude data sharing activities directly covered by these international agreements. Agreements such as the US-Mexico-Canada Agreement (USMCA), EU adequacy decisions, or bilateral agreements may already provide rules for data transfers across borders, including health data. The law could exclude these specific cross-border data transfers from its scope to avoid overlapping with these existing frameworks. The TRIPS Agreement and other IP-related treaties govern proprietary data or health technologies, which might be excluded from the law’s scope if they are already covered by IP protections. Certain health data related to national defence or military operations might be excluded from the model law’s scope, as such data is often covered by international security treaties or national laws designed to protect sensitive information. This exclusion would be necessary to ensure compliance with these frameworks. International frameworks like the Declaration of Helsinki or CIOMS International Ethical Guidelines for health-related research might already govern the handling and sharing of health data in research contexts, which could warrant exclusion from the law’s provisions. Data used by international organisations in global health initiatives or emergencies might be excluded from the model law if these organisations operate under specific international agreements that govern data sharing and use. Bilateral or multilateral agreements often contain their own detailed provisions for health data sharing, privacy, and security. If such agreements are already in place, the law could exclude these activities to avoid legal conflicts or duplication of effort.

### **Section 5: Interpretation** 

The interpretation section of the model law clarifies the intended meaning of certain terms and provisions used within the law. By providing explicit guidelines on how to understand key elements, this section helps prevent misinterpretation and ensures that the law is applied consistently and effectively across various contexts.

#### **Rationale**

*Use of possessive pronouns with relation to health data*

The use of possessive pronouns (such as “my,” “your,” or “their”) in this law when referring to health data is intended to indicate that the data relates to and identifies the relevant individual or community. It is not meant to suggest that the individual or community legally owns or holds proprietary rights to the health data. This clarification is crucial because it helps distinguish between the relational aspect of health data (i.e., data that pertains to a specific person or group) and the legal concept of ownership or proprietary rights. This distinction ensures that the law does not inadvertently convey ownership or proprietary rights where none exists, thus avoiding potential legal conflicts and ensuring that proprietary rights are properly understood and managed by the entities that generate or store the data.

*Consent and legal actions by individuals who cannot act on their own*

When the law refers to consent or other legal actions by individuals, it acknowledges that some individuals, such as minors or those with certain disabilities, may not be legally capable of performing these actions independently. In such cases, the law specifies that these actions should be conducted as outlined under the existing data protection legislation. This provision ensures that the legal rights and responsibilities related to consent and other actions are properly managed for individuals who cannot legally act on their own. By referencing the existing data protection legislation, the model law aligns itself with established legal procedures, ensuring consistency and legal protection for vulnerable individuals. This alignment avoids redundancy in legal provisions while ensuring that all individuals, regardless of their capacity to consent, are adequately protected under the law.

*Relationship with the existing data protection law*

This model law is designed to augment the existing data protection legislation, with specific focus on creating the Health Data Court and expanding the duties of the Regulator established under the existing data protection legislation. Where the model law is silent, the provisions of the existing data protection legislation should be applied. In the event of a conflict between the two laws, this model law shall prevail. The model law’s focus on specialized governance for health data recognizes that general data protection laws may not fully address the complex ethical, legal, and practical issues specific to health data. By allowing the model law to prevail in the event of a conflict, the legal framework prioritizes the specialized needs of health data governance, ensuring that these complexities are adequately addressed. This approach promotes harmonization and legal certainty, ensuring that stakeholders have a clear understanding of the legal framework governing their activities and that the specific requirements of health data governance are met.

#### **Notes on interaction with another section**

*Rights and obligations of health data generators; open access to be provided by the state (Section 10\)*

The interpretation section’s clarification that possessive pronouns do not imply legal ownership or proprietary rights directly interacts with Section 10, which outlines the rights and obligations of entities that generate or hold health data. By establishing that possessive language does not equate to ownership, the law ensures that proprietary rights in health data are correctly understood and applied.

#### **International considerations**

This section is influenced by a variety of international regulations, treaties, guidelines, and agreements, particularly those related to health data protection (e.g., GDPR), public health emergencies (e.g., IHR, PIP Framework), intellectual property (e.g., TRIPS), and cross-border data transfers. Aligning key definitions with these international frameworks ensures that the law is applied consistently, avoids conflicts with existing global standards, and supports effective data governance in both domestic and international contexts.

#### **Implementation tips**

If the model law is incorporated into an amended data protection law, then the interpretation section will need to be amended. The model law is also dependant on existing legislation having successfully addressed the problem of how to gain consent from a person (such as a minor or mentally unstable person) who is legally unable to provide consent. The introduction of proprietary rights must also be harmonised with existing legal concepts within the country (i.e. it must be possible to “own” health data in light of the common law and legislation). 

#### Part B2: Substantive provisions of the model law  

### **Section 6: Health Data Court** 

The establishment of the Health Data Court under the model law is a critical component designed to provide a specialized judicial forum for adjudicating matters related to the governance, use, and protection of health data within the relevant country. By creating a dedicated court with specific expertise in health data management, law, ethics, and technology, this model law ensures that disputes arising from the use and handling of health data are resolved in a fair, transparent, and efficient manner. The Health Data Court serves as the central authority for enforcing the provisions of this law, ensuring that all stakeholders, including individuals, communities, data controllers, and holders of proprietary rights in digital instances containing health data, are held accountable to the highest standards of legal and ethical conduct.

#### **Rationale**

*Establishment and objective of the health data court*

The law establishes the Health Data Court designed to serve as a specialized judicial body with the necessary expertise to address the complex and sensitive issues that arise under this law. The unique nature of health data, which involves sensitive personal and community information, necessitates a specialized forum for dispute resolution. General courts may lack the specific expertise required to adjudicate matters involving health data, leading to inconsistent or inadequate outcomes. The Health Data Court provides a focused and knowledgeable environment where disputes can be resolved effectively, ensuring that all parties receive fair treatment under the law.

*Jurisdiction and powers of the health data court*

The Health Data Court is granted jurisdiction over all matters arising under the model law, including disputes between the Regulator, individuals, communities, data controllers, and holders of proprietary rights in digital instances containing health data. The court is empowered to hear cases, make determinations, order remedial actions, impose penalties, and take any other actions necessary to enforce the provisions of the law. By centralizing jurisdiction over health data-related disputes in a specialized court, the model law ensures that all cases are handled with the necessary expertise and focus. The court’s broad powers allow it to address a wide range of issues, from minor infractions to significant breaches of the law, ensuring that all violations are appropriately dealt with. This comprehensive jurisdiction and authority are essential for maintaining the integrity of the health data governance framework and ensuring that all stakeholders are held accountable.

*Composition and appointment of judges*

The composition of the Health Data Court is crucial to its effectiveness. By appointing judges with specialized knowledge and experience in relevant fields, the court is equipped to handle the complex and technical issues that arise in health data governance. The selection process ensures that only individuals with the highest levels of expertise and integrity are entrusted with these important responsibilities, thereby enhancing public confidence in the court’s decisions.

*Procedural framework*

The Health Data Court is empowered to establish its own procedures for the hearing of cases, in accordance with principles of natural justice and fairness. Proceedings may be conducted in person, in writing, or electronically, as appropriate. The ability to establish its own procedures allows the Health Data Court to tailor its operations to the specific needs of health data-related cases. This flexibility ensures that the court can operate efficiently and fairly, adapting to the unique circumstances of each case. The emphasis on natural justice and fairness ensures that all parties receive due process, regardless of the format in which the proceedings are conducted.

*Appeals and enforcement*

The appeal process provides a mechanism for review, ensuring that decisions made by the Health Data Court are subject to oversight and can be corrected if necessary. This helps maintain the integrity of the judicial process and ensures that justice is upheld. The enforcement provisions ensure that the court’s decisions are respected and complied with, thereby reinforcing the authority of the court and the effectiveness of the legal framework.

*Funding and resources*

Adequate funding and resources are essential for the effective operation of the Health Data Court. Without the necessary support, the court may struggle to handle its caseload efficiently or to maintain the high standards required for the adjudication of health data-related disputes. Ensuring that the court is properly funded and resourced is crucial for its success and for maintaining public confidence in its ability to deliver justice.

*Remedies and penalties*

The Health Data Court is empowered to impose penalties for violations of the law, including requiring offenders to provide restitution to affected data subjects and ordering specific measures to rectify violations and prevent their recurrence. The court may also consider aggravating and mitigating factors in determining penalties. The ability to impose penalties and order remedies is central to the court’s role in enforcing the model law. By holding violators accountable and providing compensation to those harmed by breaches of the law, the court helps to ensure that justice is served and that the rights of individuals and communities are protected. The consideration of aggravating and mitigating factors allows for a balanced approach to penalties, ensuring that they are proportionate to the offense and take into account the specific circumstances of each case.

*Civil litigation and compliance*

Any individual, entity, or community that suffers damages as a result of a breach of this law may commence civil litigation against the responsible party in the Health Data Court for damages and/or compliance with the law. This provision empowers individuals, entities, and communities to seek justice and compensation for harm caused by breaches of the law. By allowing for civil litigation in the Health Data Court, the model law provides a clear and accessible avenue for redress, ensuring that those affected by violations of the law have the opportunity to seek remedies and hold wrongdoers accountable.

#### **Notes on interaction with other sections**

*Definitions (section 4\)*

The definitions section provides the foundational terms that the Health Data Court will rely on to interpret and adjudicate cases. Clear and precise definitions ensure that the court’s rulings are consistent with the intent of the model law, particularly when dealing with complex issues related to health data.

*Prohibition on re-identification (section 8\)*

The Health Data Court would be responsible for adjudicating cases where violations of the prohibition on re-identification are alleged. This could include assessing whether actions taken by individuals or entities constitute illegal re-identification and imposing penalties or remedial measures as necessary.

*Consent (section 9\)*

The Health Data Court would be involved in resolving disputes related to consent, particularly where there is disagreement over whether valid consent has been obtained or if a community’s rights in health data have been respected. The court would ensure that the principles of informed consent are upheld in accordance with the model law.

*Rights and obligations of health data generators; open access to be provided by the state (section 10\)*

This section outlines the proprietary rights and responsibilities of entities that generate or store health data, which the Health Data Court may need to adjudicate. Disputes arising from conflicts between health data generators and other stakeholders would fall under the court’s jurisdiction, ensuring that the proper balance between proprietary rights and public interest is maintained.

*Using health data in the public interest (section 11\)*

This section provides for the granting of use-licenses in the public interest, which may lead to disputes between the holders of proprietary rights and those seeking access to health data. The Health Data Court would adjudicate such disputes, ensuring that public interest is balanced with proprietary rights.

*Enforcement and penalties (sections 15 and 16\)*

These sections outline the penalties for violations of the model law and the enforcement mechanisms available. The Health Data Court would be the primary body responsible for determining appropriate penalties and ensuring that enforcement actions are carried out effectively.

#### **Other options of formulating the section**

*Alternative names for the health data court*

The Health Data Court can be named differently to fit within the legal culture of a country, such as “Health Data Tribunal” or “Health Information Court.” The key requirement is that it functions within the judiciary and serves as a specialized forum capable of making binding decisions on health data-related disputes.

*Using the existing court system*

An alternative approach, although less specialized, would be to not establish a separate Health Data Court and instead provide that all disputes arising under the model law should be adjudicated by the existing court system. While this option would preserve the integrity of the model law, it is suboptimal given the specialized nature of health data law and the need for judges with specific expertise in this area. This could result in less consistent and less informed rulings on complex health data issues.  

*Administrative adjudicative body*

Instead of having a specialised court within the judiciary, a country can also have an administrative body, which is situated in the executive, with adjudicative powers as set out in the model law and which guarantees their independence from the executive. 

*Regional Heath Data Court*

As the model law is country-level legislation it cannot implement a regional-level health data court which will adjudicate disputes both within and between the countries of a regional grouping. For example, the African Union (AU) could implement an AU health data court which would deal with disputes both within countries (such as a dispute between two parties in Kenya) as well as disputes between different jurisdictions (for example between Kenya and Uganda). This would require an AU-level political initiative to create an “AU Health Data Court”. 

#### **International considerations**

The role and jurisdiction of the Health Data Court in adjudicating matters as set out in the model law must be aligned with a range of international regulations, treaties, guidelines, and agreements, particularly those related to data protection (e.g., GDPR), global health security (e.g., IHR), human rights (e.g., UDHR), and intellectual property (e.g., TRIPS). Aligning the Health Data Court’s jurisdiction and rulings with these international frameworks ensures that it operates effectively in a globalised context, protecting individual rights, ensuring ethical governance of health data, and maintaining compliance with international health and privacy standards.

#### **Implementation tips**

The court should have the necessarily legitimacy in terms of the constitution (if any) and the existing legal system. The creation of a specialised court presupposes that: a) there are sufficient financial resources to sustain the court, b) the human capacity – particularly with data protection law experience – can be obtained, and c) existing laws regarding the functioning of the judiciary do not prevent the creation of this specialised court. 

In addition, procedural rules which will govern the court processes must be created, which should include: a) expediting an application by a party from compliance with section 8(5), b) resolving community disputes in a collaborative manner as required by section 9(7), c) providing licences to a party as contemplated in section 11, d) ensuring protection of whistleblowers as required by section 14, and e) determining criminal sanctions in terms of section 15\. 

### **Section 7: Individual Rights; Portability of Electronic Medical Records** 

The focus of this section is to reinforce the privacy rights of individuals concerning their personal health data while going further by addressing the specific needs and challenges associated with the digital management of health information. One of the key extensions provided by this section is the right to portability of electronic medical records (EMRs). In an era where health data is increasingly stored and transferred electronically, the right to portability is vital for empowering individuals to manage their health information more effectively.

#### **Rationale**

*Privacy rights in personal health data*

This provision affirms that all individuals have privacy rights concerning their health data, aligning with the overarching goal of protecting individual privacy within the existing data protection legislation and the broader framework of health data governance. It ensures that individuals have control over how their personal health data is handled, thereby fostering trust in the health system. Privacy is a fundamental human right and a cornerstone of data protection laws worldwide. By reinforcing this right within the model law, the section seeks to prevent unauthorized access, use, or disclosure of personal health data, which is essential for maintaining the confidentiality and integrity of such data.

*Portability of Electronic Medical Records*

In addition to the existing rights contained in the data protection legislation, the right to portability of electronic medical records (EMRs) is designed to empower individuals by enabling them to transfer their health data from one healthcare provider to another. This provision supports the model law’s objective of facilitating seamless and efficient healthcare delivery by allowing patients to move their records easily, enhancing continuity of care and improving health outcomes. Portability ensures that individuals can receive uninterrupted healthcare, even when switching providers or relocating to a different country. It also promotes patient autonomy by giving individuals the ability to manage their health information more effectively.

*Interoperability standards*

The requirement for the Regulator to establish interoperability standards ensures that EMRs can be transferred and used across different healthcare systems and providers without compatibility issues. This is crucial for achieving the model law’s goal of harmonizing health data governance and facilitating cross-border health data exchanges. Interoperability is essential for the efficient and accurate exchange of health data. Without standardized guidelines, the portability of EMRs could be hindered by technical barriers, leading to delays in care and potential health risks.

#### **Other options of formulating the section**

*Expanded scope of portability*

The section could include provisions that allow not only the transfer of EMRs between healthcare providers but also enable individuals to access and manage their EMRs directly through secure patient portals. This approach would further enhance patient autonomy by providing real-time access to health information.

*Mandatory timelines for transfer*

Instead of simply requiring healthcare providers to transfer EMRs “without delay,” the section could specify a maximum timeframe within which the transfer must be completed (e.g., within 48 hours of the request). This would ensure prompt action and reduce the risk of delays in patient care.

*Enhanced interoperability requirements*

The section could mandate that interoperability standards include not only technical specifications but also compliance with international best practices for data security, privacy, and patient safety. This would provide a more comprehensive framework for the safe and effective exchange of EMRs.

#### **Notes on interaction with other sections**

*Health Data Court (section 6\)*

Disputes regarding the portability of EMRs or the application of privacy rights may fall under the jurisdiction of the Health Data Court. Thus, the mechanisms for enforcement and resolution provided by the Health Data Court are essential for the practical implementation of this section.

*Emerging technologies (section 13\)*

As emerging technologies are increasingly integrated into healthcare, their impact on EMR portability and privacy rights must be considered. Interoperability standards will need to evolve to accommodate new technologies, ensuring that the law remains relevant in a rapidly changing technological landscape.

*Subsidiary legislation (section 17\)*

The standards and guidelines for interoperability are likely to be detailed in subsidiary legislation, making this section dependent on the timely development and issuance of such regulations by the Regulator. The adaptability of these standards to emerging needs and technologies will be crucial for the long-term effectiveness of the portability provisions.

#### **Developing of Regulations**

To guide the Regulator in developing regulations under this section, the following reference documents and existing instruments can be consulted:

*International standards*

The Regulator should reference the Health Level Seven (HL7) standards, particularly the Fast Healthcare Interoperability Resources (FHIR) framework, which is widely recognized for enabling the exchange of healthcare information electronically.

*GDPR guidelines*

The GDPR provides comprehensive guidance on data portability and can serve as a model for establishing robust data protection and transfer mechanisms.

*OECD recommendation on health data governance*

This document offers principles for health data governance that emphasize the importance of interoperability and cross-border data flows while ensuring the protection of individual rights.

*ISO 27799*

This International Organization for Standardization (ISO) standard provides guidelines for information security management in health systems, which could be integral in ensuring that interoperability standards include robust security measures.

*National legislation*

The Regulator should review existing national data protection and health information laws to ensure that the new regulations complement and enhance current legal frameworks without duplicating efforts.

**International considerations**

In addition to the above international instruments, the HL7, Fast Healthcare Interoperability Resources (FHIR), and WHO guidelines on digital health systems provide the standards necessary for the interoperability of electronic health records. Compliance with these international standards ensures that health data can be shared efficiently and securely across different healthcare providers, systems, and countries. The portability of EMRs must also be aligned with the WHO’s Global Strategy on Digital Health, which encourages countries to adopt digital health technologies to improve healthcare access and management. The OECD’s Guidelines on the Protection of Privacy and Transborder Flows of Personal Data also encourage data portability as a way to empower individuals and enhance data protection. Agreements like the US-Mexico-Canada Agreement (USMCA) and similar treaties include provisions on the transfer and protection of personal data across borders. In the context of healthcare, ensuring that EMRs can be ported across borders while complying with these trade agreements is essential for the international mobility of patients and healthcare providers.

#### **Tips for implementation**

Before individuals can exercise their right to electronic portability of records, minimum standards for interoperability of health data must not only be created, but a concerted campaign to align healthcare providers must be conducted. It does little good to enforce this right, only for health data to be compromised due to insufficient security, insufficient understanding of the complexity of health data portability and a lack of understanding of international health data portability protocols and standards. Giving effect to this section prematurely may result in more harm than good if successive security / legal breaches occur which in turn will damage public trust in health providers. Additionally, the cost of implementing this section is significant and careful coordination with and assistance to healthcare providers will be required. 

### **Section 8: Prohibition on Re-identification** 

This section establishes a critical safeguard in the governance of health data by prohibiting the re-identification of individuals from anonymised or pseudonymised health data. Anonymisation and pseudonymisation are key techniques used to protect individuals’ privacy by removing or masking personally identifiable information from datasets. However, as data analytics and technology advance, the risk of re-identifying individuals from such datasets increases, potentially compromising privacy and leading to unintended consequences.

The prohibition on re-identification reflects a strong commitment to protecting the privacy and confidentiality of individuals whose health data is included in anonymised or pseudonymised datasets. By making it illegal to intentionally re-identify data, this section helps to maintain the integrity of privacy protections and fosters trust in the data governance framework. It ensures that health data can be used for research, public health, and other beneficial purposes without exposing individuals to the risk of being identified against their will.

In line with a custodianship approach to data governance, this section places a legal and ethical duty on those who hold or process anonymised or pseudonymised health data to respect the privacy rights of individuals. It underscores the principle that health data, even when anonymised, should be handled with the utmost care and responsibility. By establishing clear prohibitions and accountability measures, this section aims to prevent the misuse of health data and protect the fundamental rights of individuals, reinforcing the ethical foundations of health data governance.

#### **Rationale**

*Prohibition on re-identification*

The primary intent of this provision is to protect the privacy and confidentiality of individuals whose personal health data has been anonymised or pseudonymised. Personal health data is highly sensitive, and by placing a clear prohibition on re-identifying such data without permission, this section ensures that the model law goes beyond general data protection laws in safeguarding individual privacy. Anonymisation and pseudonymisation are key techniques for safeguarding personal data in research and healthcare. This prohibition is crucial for maintaining the integrity of these processes and ensuring that individuals’ data remains protected, even when used for secondary purposes like research.

*Authorization of robustness testing*

This provision allows holders of proprietary rights in digital instances containing personal health data to authorize testing of anonymisation or pseudonymisation processes. This ensures that the techniques used are effective and can withstand attempts at re-identification. Robustness testing is essential for ensuring that anonymisation and pseudonymisation processes are secure. It allows data holders to identify and address vulnerabilities before they can be exploited, thereby reinforcing the protection of personal data.

*Reporting vulnerabilities*

This clause obligates individuals or entities that discover vulnerabilities in anonymised or pseudonymised data to report them to the relevant parties, including the Regulator. This helps in the early identification and mitigation of risks associated with potential re-identification. Prompt reporting of vulnerabilities is critical for proactive risk management. It enables data holders and regulators to take timely actions to protect personal data, thereby minimizing the potential for harm.

*Obligation to address re-identification risks*

This provision requires holders of proprietary rights in digital instances containing personal health data to assess and address re-identification risks once they are informed of them. This ensures that data protection measures are continually strengthened in response to emerging threats. This ongoing obligation reinforces the dynamic nature of data protection, recognizing that security measures must evolve as new vulnerabilities are discovered and helps maintain the overall security of health data.

*Discretionary lifting of the prohibition by the Health Data Court*

This clause provides a mechanism for the Health Data Court to lift the prohibition on re-identification in specific cases, where justified, and under certain conditions. This ensures flexibility in the application of the law, allowing for exceptions in situations where re-identification may be necessary, such as for public health research or legal investigations. This flexibility is important for balancing privacy protection with the need for legitimate access to re-identified data in exceptional cases. It provides a legal pathway for controlled re-identification while safeguarding the interests of affected individuals. 

Should the Health Data Court not be established, it is crucial that either existing courts or the Regulator be mandated to potentially lift the prohibition on re-identification under certain conditions, which can be specified. This ensures that there is always a legal mechanism in place to address exceptional cases where re-identification is necessary.

#### **Other options of formulating the section**

*Mandated independent audits*

Instead of relying solely on the holder’s authorization for robustness testing, the section could mandate periodic independent audits of anonymisation and pseudonymisation processes. This would ensure a higher level of scrutiny and reduce the risk of vulnerabilities being overlooked.

*Mandatory penalties for non-reporting*

The section could explicitly include penalties for failing to report vulnerabilities within the specified timeframe. This would strengthen compliance and ensure that all parties take their reporting obligations seriously. The duty to report could also be inserted into section 14 (whistle-blowers). 

*Automatic trigger for re-assessment* 

The law could specify that any reported vulnerability automatically triggers a mandatory re-assessment of the anonymisation or pseudonymisation process, rather than leaving it to the discretion of the data holder. This would ensure a more consistent approach to addressing risks.

*Mandated self-certification*

The law could also provide that specific individuals must actively certify that reasonable tests have been conducted on the data to ensure it is anonymised and to provide the methodology used to arrive at the conclusion that the data is anonymised. 

#### **Notes on interaction with other sections**

*Health Data Court (section 6\)*

The role of the Health Data Court in potentially lifting the prohibition on re-identification ties this section directly to the Court’s jurisdiction. The Court’s ability to make exceptions ensures that the law can adapt to specific circumstances where re-identification may be warranted. If the Health Data Court is not established, this role should be assigned to existing courts or the Regulator.

*Individual rights; portability of electronic medical records (section 7\)*

The prohibition on re-identification supports the privacy rights established in Section 7 by preventing unauthorized identification of individuals in anonymised datasets, thereby reinforcing the confidentiality of their personal health data.

*Emerging technologies (section 13\)*

As new technologies are developed, they may present new methods for re-identification. This section must be adaptable to address these emerging threats, ensuring that protections remain robust against new forms of data analysis or manipulation.

*Offences and Penalties (section 15 and 16\)*

Any breach of this section’s provisions could be categorised under offenses related to unauthorised data use or gross failure to protect health data. The penalties section should reflect the seriousness of such breaches, providing for appropriate fines, sanctions, or other consequences.

#### **Important considerations**

At a fundamental level, parties who have de-identified data need to be aware of the prohibition on reidentification and the data that may – when reidentified – be classified as “personal health data”. This section will require a public enlightenment campaign to ensure data subjects are aware of this right and data controllers are aware of this duty. 

**International considerations**

The GDPR includes provisions that prohibit the re-identification of anonymised data, aligning with the principle that anonymised data should remain secure and that re-identification efforts should be illegal. The model law’s prohibition on re-identification must be consistent with such international regulations to ensure compliance with global privacy standards. The IHR require member states to share health-related information during public health emergencies, but such data sharing must respect privacy and data protection principles. The prohibition on re-identification aligns with these international commitments to privacy protection in health data sharing. The OECD and WHO’s guidelines on data sharing during pandemics guidelines encourage countries to implement robust data protection measures to facilitate cross-border data flows while safeguarding individual privacy. The prohibition on re-identification would need to comply with these guidelines, particularly when anonymised or pseudonymised health data is transferred across borders for research or public health purposes. Frameworks like the ISO/IEC 27001 for information security management systems and the NIST Cybersecurity Framework provide guidelines for protecting sensitive data, including ensuring that anonymised data cannot be re-identified. The section’s prohibition on re-identification should align with these international standards to ensure that health data remains secure and protected from unauthorised re-identification attempts.

### **Section 9: Communities’ Rights in their Community Health Data** 

This section establishes the legal framework for recognizing and protecting the rights of communities in relation to their collective health data. The section ensures that communities have a formal, recognized role in the management and decision-making processes concerning their community health data, thus safeguarding their collective interests. 

At the core of this section is the principle that communities should have control over how their health data is used, shared, and managed. This is facilitated through the establishment of representative bodies that act on behalf of the community, ensuring that the community’s voice is central to any decisions made regarding their health data. 

The section also emphasizes the protection of individual rights within the community framework, ensuring that collective decisions do not override the rights of individual community members as established under existing data protection laws. Additionally, mechanisms are provided for resolving disputes within the community, including the right of individual members to seek recourse if they disagree with decisions made by the representative body.

By recognizing communities as key stakeholders in the governance of their health data, this section promotes a more equitable, inclusive, and respectful approach to health data governance, aligning with broader goals of social justice and community empowerment.

#### **Rationale**

*Community representation*

This provision ensures that communities, which consist of individuals sharing common geographical, cultural, or social identities, have a formal and recognized way to participate in decisions regarding their collective health data. By acting through a representative body, the community’s interests are collectively managed and protected under this model law. Community health data often reflects sensitive and culturally significant information. Empowering communities to have a say in how their data is used aligns with principles of autonomy, respect, and collective rights. It helps safeguard against the exploitation of such data and ensures that the community benefits from its use.

*Establishment of representative bodies*

This provision mandates the relevant national authority to establish clear and transparent criteria through subsidiary legislation for recognizing representative bodies. It also ensures that mechanisms are put in place to support the effective functioning of these bodies. Representative bodies must be legitimate and effectively operational to genuinely represent the community’s interests. Transparent criteria for their recognition and support mechanisms are essential for maintaining trust in the governance of community health data and ensuring that these bodies can function independently and effectively.

*Community consent for data processing*

The requirement that a community’s health data can only be processed with the community’s consent ensures that the community has control over how its data is used. This consent can be conditional, providing communities with leverage to negotiate benefits or protections. Consent is a foundational principle of data protection. For communities, particularly marginalized or indigenous groups, this consent requirement is vital for protecting their collective rights and ensuring that data use aligns with their values and interests.

*Conditional consent*

Allowing communities to condition their consent on specific benefits ensures that they can negotiate terms that directly benefit them, while also safeguarding against conditions that might contravene other legal norms. For example, in countries like Nigeria and South Africa, providing any reward beyond compensation for reasonable costs incurred by individuals who provide biological samples is illegal. Conditional consent provides flexibility and empowers communities to secure tangible benefits from the use of their health data. This can include anything from monetary compensation to healthcare services and fostering a more equitable relationship between data controllers and communities. The legal constraints on rewards ensure that such conditions are ethically and legally sound.

*Guidelines for consent conditions*

The relevant national authority is tasked with establishing guidelines to ensure that conditions attached to community consent are fair, reasonable, and legally compliant. These guidelines help standardize the process of attaching conditions to consent, ensuring that these conditions do not undermine legal norms or the rights of individuals within the community. They also provide clarity for both communities and data controllers, preventing potential disputes or ethical issues.

*Protection of individual rights*

This provision clarifies that community consent does not override the rights of individual members as provided in existing data protection legislation. This dual layer of protection ensures that individuals retain their rights even when their data is part of a collective dataset. It is crucial to ensure that, where community rights conflict with individual rights the latter takes priority. This ensures that individuals within a community do not lose their data protection rights when community data is being processed.

*Dispute resolution*

Providing community members with the right to petition their representative body and seek a review from the Health Data Court if their concerns are not addressed ensures that dissenting voices within a community are heard and can be legally acted upon. This mechanism is essential for maintaining transparency and accountability within the community’s decision-making process. It ensures that the community’s governance is democratic and that individual members have recourse if they believe their interests are not being adequately represented.

*Data security obligations*

This provision places a legal obligation on data controllers to protect community health data by implementing technical and organizational measures to prevent unauthorized access, loss, or destruction of the data. Given the sensitive nature of community health data, it is critical to ensure that it is securely managed. This provision safeguards against breaches that could harm the community or undermine trust in health data governance.

*Enhanced negotiating power*

It is more likely that the representative body – as opposed to individual data subjects \- will have the necessary negotiating power and capacity to negotiate on an equal footing with healthcare researchers and companies when community consent is requested. 

#### **Other options of formulating the section**

*Collective consent mechanism*

Instead of requiring a single representative body, the section could allow for the possibility of multiple representative bodies within a community, each with specific mandates (e.g., cultural, health-related). This would allow for a more nuanced approach to managing different types of community health data.

*Independent oversight body*

An alternative approach could involve establishing an independent oversight body that reviews and approves the criteria for representative bodies and the conditions attached to community consent. This would add an additional layer of accountability and ensure that the interests of all community members are considered.

*Enhanced transparency measures*

The section could require data controllers to publicly disclose the terms of community consent, and the benefits provided to the community. This would ensure transparency and prevent exploitation or misuse of community health data.

*Reversed onus*

An alternative approach to the default of individual consent would be to resort to community consent as default, provided that any individual data subject could opt-out of this consent. This approach could be particularly useful in rural areas where access to all affected data subjects could be practically impossible. Care would need to be taken to ensure that this section is not abused or incorrectly applied. 

#### **Notes on interaction with other sections**

*Health Data Court (section 6\)*

The Health Data Court’s role in adjudicating disputes related to community health data is critical. The Court’s ability to review decisions made by community representative bodies ensures that the rights of individual community members are protected, and that the community’s governance process is fair and transparent.

*Individual rights; portability of electronic medical records (section 7\)*

The protection of individual rights within the community context ties directly into the broader framework of individual privacy rights. Both sections emphasize the importance of consent and the protection of personal data, ensuring that individual rights are not overshadowed by collective community decisions.

*Using health data in the public interest (section 11\)*

The community consent provision interacts with the public interest use of health data. It ensures that communities have a say in whether their data is used for public interest purposes, and that such use is subject to the conditions they set.

*Offences and penalties (section 15 and 16\)*

The security obligations imposed on data controllers are reinforced by the offenses and penalties sections, which provide legal consequences for breaches. This interaction ensures that there are robust mechanisms in place to enforce the protection of community health data.

#### **Developing mechanisms and guidelines**

To guide the relevant national authority in developing both mechanisms in subsidiary legislation and guidelines under this section, the following reference documents and existing instruments can be consulted:

*UN Declaration on the Rights of Indigenous Peoples (UNDRIP)*

This document provides important principles regarding the rights of indigenous communities, including their right to control over cultural heritage which may include collective data. It can inform the development of mechanisms for recognizing representative bodies.

*Convention 169 \- Indigenous and Tribal Peoples Convention, 1989 (ILO 169\)* 

This international labour convention outlines the rights of indigenous and tribal peoples, including their right to participate in decisions affecting their communities, which can inform the criteria for representative bodies.

*GDPR’s Recital 75*

The GDPR highlights the need to consider risks to the rights and freedoms of individuals, including collective risks, which can inform the development of guidelines for community consent conditions.

#### **International considerations**

In addition to the international instruments mentioned above, the IHR emphasize the need for accurate and timely data collection and sharing during public health emergencies. However, these regulations also stress the importance of respecting individual and community rights in the process. The IHR’s principles for transparency, collaboration, and respect for privacy are directly relevant to how communities manage and share their collective health data. The UDHR and the ICCPR provide a framework for protecting individual rights, including privacy, autonomy, and participation in decision-making processes. This section’s emphasis on balancing collective community decisions with individual rights must align with these international human rights standards to ensure that community governance mechanisms do not override personal freedoms. Other international frameworks, such as the Convention on Biological Diversity (CBD), also recognise the rights of indigenous and local communities to control their own resources and data which could provide legal backing for the community health data governance models established in this section, ensuring that communities are empowered to make decisions over their collective health data. The WHO and the United Nations (UN) promote the equitable involvement of communities in public health decision-making, particularly in contexts involving health data. The section’s principles for community empowerment and inclusive governance should align with these global health equity guidelines to ensure that marginalised or vulnerable communities have a voice in decisions that affect their health and well-being. The OECD’s Guidelines on Data Governance and the FAIR Principles (Findability, Accessibility, Interoperability, and Reusability) for data stewardship, set out best practices for managing collective datasets, including community health data. The section’s establishment of community representative bodies to oversee health data governance must comply with these guidelines to ensure responsible data management and ethical use. The PIP Framework and similar global health data-sharing agreements emphasise the importance of data access for public health preparedness and response. The section must balance the need for community control over health data with global obligations to share critical health information during pandemics, while ensuring that communities are informed and consent to such data-sharing practices. 

#### **Implementation tips**

Some countries have existing laws which define what a “community” is and provide various powers and impose duties on the community heads. Examples of these laws are tribal / first nations legislation. A comprehensive review of any legislation as well as consultation with these communities is necessary to ensure they are aware of their expanded rights and duties set out in the model law. 

### **Section 10: Rights and Obligations of Health Data Generators; Open Access to be Provided by the State** 

This section establishes the legal framework for recognizing the rights and obligations of health data generators, as well as the state’s role in ensuring open access to non-identifying health data for the benefit of the public. By formalizing the concept of proprietary rights in health data instances, the section incentivizes the collection and generation of health data while also setting clear boundaries to ensure that these rights do not infringe upon individual privacy or community rights. 

Central to this section is the adoption of a custodianship approach to health data proprietorship, where proprietary rights in health data instances are not viewed as absolute ownership but rather as a responsibility to manage and use the data in a way that fulfils legal duties and serves the public interest. This approach emphasizes that those who hold proprietary rights must do so with a sense of stewardship, ensuring that the data is used ethically and in compliance with broader societal obligations.

The state, as a health data proprietor, is held to an even higher duty under this custodianship approach. As the custodian of non-identifying health data owned by government departments or agencies, the state has a responsibility to ensure that this data is made accessible to the public in a way that promotes transparency, fosters research and innovation, and supports public health initiatives. However, the state’s duty also includes safeguarding sensitive community health data and ensuring that any data shared complies with established interoperability standards.

Through this framework, the section aims to balance the encouragement of responsible health data generation and management with the need to ensure that such data is utilized for the greater good, particularly in advancing public health and research. The custodianship approach underscores the ethical and legal responsibilities of both individual health data proprietors and the state in managing health data in a way that prioritizes the public interest.

#### **Rationale**

*Proprietary rights of health data generators*

This provision recognizes that individuals or entities that collect or generate health data and store it in digital format acquire proprietary rights in these digital instances. However, these rights are not absolute and are subject to important limitations to protect individual privacy and community rights. The term “proprietary rights” has been used instead of “ownership” to underscore that these rights are not absolute and are inherently limited by the need to respect privacy and community protections. By establishing proprietary rights, the section incentivizes the generation and collection of health data, which is crucial for advancing healthcare, research, and public health initiatives. However, the limitations ensure that these proprietary rights do not infringe upon the fundamental privacy rights of individuals or the collective rights of communities.

*Supersession of proprietary rights by privacy and community rights*

This provision explicitly states that when proprietary rights in health data conflict with individual privacy rights (as outlined in Section 7\) or community rights (as outlined in Section 9), the privacy and community rights take precedence. This ensures that the protection of personal and community data is prioritized over commercial or proprietary interests. The primacy of privacy and community rights reinforces the ethical use of health data. It prevents the misuse of health data in ways that could harm individuals or communities, ensuring that proprietary rights do not override fundamental human rights.

*Enforcement of proprietary rights to fulfil legal duties*

This clause mandates that health data generators who hold proprietary rights must enforce these rights to fulfil their legal obligations under the existing data protection legislation. A custodianship approach to health data proprietorship is followed, where health data proprietorship is not merely about rights but also about using those rights to meet legal duties and responsibilities. Aligning proprietary rights with legal duties ensures that health data is managed in a manner that complies with data protection laws, thereby safeguarding the rights of individuals and communities while allowing for the beneficial use of health data.

*State’s obligation to provide open access*

This provision requires the state to make non-identifying health data owned by government departments or agencies publicly accessible. Open access to such data promotes transparency, enhances public trust, and facilitates research and innovation by making valuable data resources available to the public. Open access to non-identifying health data supports a wide range of public benefits, including the advancement of scientific research, the development of public health policies, and the empowerment of individuals and communities through access to information. However, the state must ensure that any data classified as community health data complies with the protections outlined in Section 9 before being made accessible.

*Administrative measures to support open access*

This provision outlines the state’s responsibility to take reasonable administrative measures to support open access to non-identifying health data. This includes cataloguing, publishing, and ensuring barrier-free and cost-free access to the data, as well as ensuring compliance with interoperability standards. The administrative measures outlined in this section are crucial for the effective implementation of open access policies. By ensuring that data is properly catalogued, published, and accessible, the state facilitates the widespread use of health data for public benefit. Compliance with interoperability standards, as determined by the Regulator, ensures that the shared data can be effectively utilized across different platforms and systems, fostering seamless integration and wider applicability.

#### **Other options of formulating the section**

*Data ownership*

Instead of referring to ‘proprietary rights’, the section could instead refer to ‘ownership’. As the remainder of the sections makes clear that such proprietary right or ownership is qualified and must be used in certain ways, the outcome in practice will be the same. This is merely a semantic choice. Each country should use the word that it is most comfortable with. 

*Time-limited proprietary rights*

Instead of granting perpetual proprietary rights to health data generators, the section could limit these rights to specific uses or timeframes, after which the data must be shared with public health bodies or research institutions. This would balance the interests of data generators with broader public health goals.

*Interaction with intellectual property rights*

The concept of proprietary rights in data is in its nascent stage and most legal professionals still only approach data from an intellectual property standpoint where laws define what data is protected by copyright, patent, trademark and design as well as appropriate remedies for the infringement of these rights. It is important to note that a proprietary right is over and above these intellectual property rights and by contrast utilises well-established proprietary remedies available to the owner of a “thing” similar to the rights that the owner of a motor vehicle has to recover the vehicle or to recover damages suffered by the owner. 

#### **Notes on interaction with other sections**

*Individual rights; portability of electronic medical records (section 7\)*

The provision that individual privacy rights supersede proprietary rights ties directly into the protections afforded under Section 7\. This ensures that the proprietary rights of health data generators do not override the fundamental privacy rights of individuals.

*Communities’ rights in their community health data (section 9\)*

The interaction with Section 9 is critical, as it ensures that community rights are protected even when the state seeks to provide open access to non-identifying data. The state must comply with the requirements of Section 9 before making any community health data publicly accessible.

*Using health data in the public interest (section 11\)*

This section is a crucial limitation on proprietary rights in health data. It allows for the possibility that even if a health data generator holds proprietary rights, these can be overridden if the data is needed for public interest purposes. The Health Data Court can grant use-licenses for such data, ensuring that public interest is prioritized over proprietary claims.

*Emerging technologies (section 13\)*

The state’s responsibility to ensure that shared data complies with interoperability standards as determined by the Regulator is linked to the requirements under Section 13, where emerging technologies may introduce new standards or challenges in data interoperability. The alignment of these standards ensures that health data can be efficiently and securely integrated across different technological platforms.

*Subsidiary legislation and guidelines (section 17\)*

The administrative measures to support open access and the conditions under which proprietary rights can be exercised must be consistent with the broader goals of the model law as detailed in Section 17\. This ensures a cohesive approach to the implementation of open access and the enforcement of proprietary rights in line with the overarching framework of health data governance.

#### **International considerations**

The GDPR and frameworks such as those from the OECD provide guidelines for managing personal and non-identifying data, with particular emphasis on safeguarding privacy. The custodianship approach, which emphasises responsible data management, must align with these international standards to ensure the protection of privacy while enabling open access to non-identifiable data. The IHR, coordinated by the WHO, emphasise the importance of sharing health data during pandemics to ensure a coordinated global response. The state's role as a health data custodian, particularly in sharing non-identifying health data for public health and research purposes, must align with the IHR’s requirements for transparency and data sharing. WHO guidelines on data sharing and open access encourage making health data available to foster innovation, transparency, and public health research. Aligning with these guidelines ensures that the state meets global expectations for promoting research and public health while protecting sensitive data. International standards, such as those developed by HL7 and the WHO’s interoperability guidelines, dictate how health data should be structured and shared across borders. The subsidiary legislation in this section will need to ensure that the health data made accessible by the state adheres to these standards to facilitate cross-border research and global public health collaborations. Initiatives like the Global Health Security Agenda (GHSA) and the PIP Framework emphasise the importance of sharing health data for research and innovation. By providing open access to non-identifying health data, the state contributes to these global research initiatives, ensuring that data generated for the public good is available for the broader international community. The TRIPS Agreement under the WTO governs the protection of intellectual property, and this could influence how proprietary rights in health data are managed. Subsidiary legislation would need to ensure that proprietary health data is protected in a way that aligns with international IP agreements, especially when the data contributes to innovations in health technologies. 

#### **Implementation tips**

The creation of proprietary rights in this section often results in the assumption that data protection rights no longer apply. While this assumption is false – data protection rights supersede proprietary rights as set out in section 10(1)(a) – it is possible for uninformed stakeholders to object to this section without truly understanding its objective, which is to incentivise health data generators to develop new and useful medical techniques, treatments and pharmaceuticals which will ultimately benefit the general public. A public campaign to increase awareness of the true operation of this section may be necessary to avoid this misunderstanding which often results in highly emotive responses. Additionally the impact of health data being capable of ownership \- and the resultant proprietary rights such as the return of ownership – should be carefully considered in both existing legislation and the common law. 

Research suggests that health data tends to be siloed due to unreasonable concerns and misunderstanding of data protection laws. Rather than being restrictive – i.e. impeding the use of health data – this section creates a positive duty on the state to provide open access to non-identifying health data to encourage research. In order to implement this section the state must conduct an audit of available data sources as well as develop a plan per state department and institution to give effect to this section. 

### **Section 11: Using Health Data in the Public Interest** 

The purpose of this section is to establish a legal framework that allows for the use of health data in situations where it serves the public interest, even when such data is held under proprietary rights by a health data proprietor. This section is akin to the concept of compulsory licensing in patent law, where an entity may be granted the right to use a patented invention without the consent of the patent holder, typically in cases where the use is deemed essential for the public good.

In the context of patent law, the TRIPS Agreement provides for compulsory licensing under specific conditions, particularly to address public health needs. TRIPS allows countries to issue compulsory licenses in situations such as public health emergencies, where access to essential medicines or technologies is necessary for the well-being of the population. Similarly, this section enables the Health Data Court (or the body that is the alternative to the heath data court as set out in section 6\) to grant use-licenses for health data when it is necessary to advance the public interest, ensuring that critical health data can be accessed for research, public health initiatives, or other socially beneficial purposes, even if the health data proprietor does not consent.

The section carefully balances the rights of the health data proprietor with the need to serve the public interest. By providing a legal mechanism for accessing health data in the public interest, this section ensures that proprietary rights do not obstruct the use of data that could significantly benefit society.

#### **Rationale**

*Disclosure of proprietary rights*

This provision mandates that any individual or entity with proprietary rights related to health data instances must disclose these rights upon request. The requirement to disclose proprietary rights ensures transparency in the ownership and control of health data, which is essential for assessing the potential public interest in the data’s use. Transparency in proprietary rights is critical for enabling stakeholders, including researchers, public health officials, and policymakers, to identify and access health data that could serve the public interest. It reduces barriers to data access and facilitates informed decision-making regarding the use of health data for public benefit.

*Exclusion by subsidiary legislation*

This provision allows the relevant national authority to exclude certain classes of individuals or entities from the disclosure requirement. Such exclusions may be necessary to protect sensitive information or to accommodate specific legal or regulatory considerations. Providing the flexibility to exclude certain entities ensures that the law can be adapted to protect national security, sensitive commercial interests, or other critical considerations, without undermining the broader goal of promoting transparency and public interest.

*Detailed description of health data*

This clause requires health data proprietors to provide a description of the kinds of health data they hold upon request. This ensures that those seeking to use the data for public interest purposes have enough information to determine its relevance to their needs. Access to detailed descriptions of health data is crucial for enabling effective public health research and other initiatives that rely on specific data types. This provision ensures that potential applicants can make informed decisions about pursuing access to the data.

*Application for public interest use-licence*

This provision allows individuals or entities to apply to the Health Data Court for a use-license when the data is deemed necessary for advancing the public interest. This process provides a legal mechanism to override proprietary rights in favour of public benefit. Public interest use-licenses are a vital tool for ensuring that health data is accessible for purposes that benefit society, such as medical research, public health initiatives, and policy development. This provision strikes a balance between respecting proprietary rights and promoting the common good.

*Criteria for granting use-licences*

The Health Data Court is tasked with evaluating the application for a use-license by considering several factors, including the nature of the public interest, potential benefits, reasons for refusal, market practices, and potential risks. This ensures that the decision to grant a license, including possibly subjecting the licence to certain conditions, is well-informed and balanced. By considering a broad range of factors, the Health Data Court can ensure that use-licenses are granted only when it is clearly in the public interest, and that the rights of individuals and communities are protected. This thorough evaluation process helps to prevent misuse of the data while maximizing public benefits.

*Determination of licence fee*

This provision allows the Health Data Court to set a reasonable license fee for the use of health data, considering various factors such as the public interest, the costs incurred by the health data proprietor, and the applicant’s financial position. Setting a fair license fee ensures that the health data proprietor is compensated for their investment while not imposing prohibitive costs on the applicant, particularly when the public interest is at stake. This helps to encourage the use of health data for socially beneficial purposes.

*Discretion to set licence fee at zero*

The Health Data Court has the discretion to waive the license fee entirely if the use of the data serves a paramount public interest or if the data was obtained or maintained using significant public funds. This ensures that financial considerations do not obstruct critical public interest uses of health data. Waiving the license fee in cases of significant public interest or publicly funded data ensures that important health data is accessible to those who need it most, without financial barriers. This is especially important for public health emergencies and related research.

*Duration and scope of use-licence*

The Health Data Court is responsible for specifying the duration of the use-license and any limitations on the scope of the data’s use. This ensures that the data is used appropriately and only for the intended public interest purpose. Limiting the duration and scope of the license ensures that the use of the data remains focused on the public interest goal and prevents potential misuse or overreach. It also allows for reassessment if the circumstances or public interest needs change.

*Monitoring compliance*

This provision allows the Health Data Court to establish mechanisms for monitoring the use of the health data under the granted license. This ensures ongoing compliance with the terms of the license and protects the rights of individuals and communities. Continuous monitoring is essential to ensure that the health data is used in accordance with the agreed terms and that any risks to individuals or communities are mitigated. It provides a safeguard against misuse and helps maintain trust in the data governance system.

#### **Other options of formulating the section**

*Mandatory public interest disclosure*

Instead of requiring individuals or entities to disclose proprietary rights upon request, the law could mandate automatic public disclosure of all proprietary health data instances, unless specifically exempted by the relevant national authority. This would further enhance transparency.

*Centralized public interest review board*

Rather than relying solely on the Health Data Court, a centralised public interest review board could be established to assess applications for use-licenses. This board could include public health experts, ethicists, and community representatives, ensuring a multidisciplinary approach to evaluating the public interest.

*Sliding scale for licence fees*

The section could introduce a sliding scale for license fees based on the applicant’s ability to pay and the scale of public benefit. This approach would provide greater flexibility in setting fees and ensure that smaller entities or non-profits are not unduly burdened.

#### **Notes on interaction with other sections**

*Health data court (section 6\)*

The role of the Health Data Court is central to this section, as it is the body responsible for adjudicating applications for public interest use-licenses, setting license fees, and monitoring compliance. The Court’s decisions will have a significant impact on how health data is accessed and used for public benefit.

*Rights and obligations of health data generators (section 10\)*

This section interacts directly with the proprietary rights outlined in Section 10\. It limits those rights by providing a legal pathway for overriding them in the public interest, ensuring that proprietary claims do not obstruct important public health or research initiatives.

*Emerging technologies (section 13\)*

The use of health data in emerging technologies may require special consideration under this section, particularly regarding the scope and duration of use-licenses. As technologies evolve, the Health Data Court may need to revisit or update licenses to reflect new risks or opportunities associated with technological advancements.

*Offences and penalties (section 15 and 16\)*

Compliance with the terms of a public interest use-license is critical. Any breach of these terms could be subject to penalties outlined in Sections 15 and 16, ensuring that the licensee adheres to the conditions set by the Health Data Court.

*Interoperability standards*

Compliance with interoperability standards, as determined by the Regulator, is essential for ensuring that the health data can be effectively utilised across different systems and platforms. This requirement ensures that data shared under a public interest use-license can be integrated and used efficiently in various applications.

#### **International considerations** 

The legal framework for using health data in the public interest would likely depend on the principles established under TRIPS, particularly Articles 31 and 31bis, which deal with compulsory licensing and public health exceptions. The section on health data use would need to incorporate or reference the conditions under which compulsory licenses are issued under TRIPS which include ensuring that such use is for non-commercial purposes, providing adequate remuneration to the data proprietor, and adhering to due process. In addition, this section would also need to be harmonised with existing national IP laws to avoid legal conflicts. For example, if national laws provide for more restrictive compulsory licensing conditions, this section will need to navigate these constraints or propose amendments to existing laws to allow for the public interest use of health data. The use of health data, even in the public interest, must comply with data protection laws and public health directives. This section also needs to align with data protection regulations like the GDPR in the European Union or equivalent frameworks in other jurisdictions. It must ensure that any use of health data in the public interest does not violate data protection principles, such as the necessity and proportionality of data use, the minimisation of data collected, and the provision of adequate safeguards. Lastly, international agreements related to health data, such as those under the WHO or other global health bodies, could influence the implementation of this section. These agreements may establish guidelines on data sharing during pandemics or other public health crises. This section must therefore ensure that its provisions for public interest use of health data are consistent with international commitments, particularly those concerning cross-border data sharing and cooperation during global health emergencies.

#### **Implementation tips** 

This section was developed to prevent a party from withholding health data which has the potential to be used for the benefit of the public, but which \- due to commercial interests or simply inertia \- is being underutilised. Care should be taken to ensure that this section does not undermine the proprietary rights of healthcare providers as set out in this section and in section 10\. It is recommended that a test be formulated to consider relevant factors for the granting of the licence over and above the requirements of this section, which may include a requirement to conduct an impact assessment if the licence were to be granted and licence monitoring as required by section 11(9). 

### **Section 12: Pandemics and Other Health Emergencies** 

The purpose of this section is to facilitate the incorporation and implementation of the Pandemic Prevention, Preparedness and Response Instrument (the “Instrument”) into domestic law once it has been ratified by the relevant country. The Instrument, drafted and negotiated by the intergovernmental negotiating body, aims to enhance global health security by establishing comprehensive guidelines and obligations for countries to better prevent, prepare for, and respond to pandemics and other health emergencies. This section ensures that the relevant country aligns its domestic legal framework with international standards as set forth in the Instrument, and that any necessary adjustments are made to existing legislation and policies to ensure compliance.

#### **Rationale**

*Incorporation of the instrument into domestic law*

This provision mandates that upon ratification of the Instrument by the relevant country, the provisions of the Instrument shall be automatically incorporated into domestic law. The provision also specifies that the Instrument will enter into force on a date set by the \[relevant national authority\]. The automatic incorporation of the Instrument ensures that the relevant country swiftly aligns its domestic legal framework with international standards for pandemic prevention, preparedness, and response. This alignment is crucial for ensuring that the relevant country is equipped to meet its international obligations and effectively manage health emergencies.

*Public consultation on implementation*

Before the Instrument comes into effect, the \[relevant national authority\] is required to engage in public consultation regarding the implementation of its provisions within the domestic context. This ensures that the views and concerns of various stakeholders, including the public, health professionals, and policymakers, are considered. Public consultation is essential for fostering transparency, inclusivity, and public trust in the implementation process. It allows for the identification of potential challenges and opportunities in adapting the Instrument’s provisions to the specific needs and context of the relevant country.

*Review of existing legislation and policies*

The section requires the \[relevant national authorities\] to conduct a comprehensive review of existing legislation and policies to identify and address any conflicts or inconsistencies with the Instrument. The findings and recommendations from this review must be submitted to the \[national legislature\] for any necessary amendments. This review process is critical for ensuring that the relevant country’s legal framework is coherent and aligned with the obligations set out in the Instrument. By identifying and rectifying any legal inconsistencies, the relevant country can avoid potential conflicts and ensure a smooth integration of the Instrument’s provisions into domestic law.

*Empowerment of the regulator to issue directives and guidelines*

Once the Instrument enters into force, the Regulator is empowered to issue directives and guidelines for the effective implementation of its provisions, particularly as they relate to health data. The Regulator’s role in issuing directives and guidelines is essential for the practical application of the Instrument within the relevant country. These guidelines will help ensure that health data is managed and used in accordance with international best practices, particularly during health emergencies, where timely and accurate data is crucial for effective response efforts.

#### **Other options of formulating the section**

*Delayed incorporation with parliamentary approval*

Instead of automatic incorporation upon ratification, the section could require parliamentary approval before the Instrument’s provisions are incorporated into domestic law. This approach would provide an additional layer of legislative scrutiny but could delay the alignment with international standards.

*Phased implementation*

The section could allow for phased implementation of the Instrument’s provisions, prioritising the most urgent aspects of pandemic preparedness and response while gradually integrating other elements. This would enable a more manageable and targeted approach to incorporating the Instrument.

*Specific monitoring mechanism*

The section could include a requirement for the establishment of a specific monitoring mechanism to oversee the implementation of the Instrument’s provisions. This mechanism could provide regular reports to the national legislature on progress and challenges.

#### **Notes on interaction with other sections**

*Health Data Court (section 6\)*

The Health Data Court may play a role in resolving disputes related to the application of the Instrument, particularly in cases where there is a conflict between domestic law and the provisions of the Instrument. The Court’s decisions will help ensure that the relevant country complies with its international obligations.

*Rights and obligations of health data generators (section 10\)*

The incorporation of the Instrument may impose additional obligations on health data generators, particularly concerning data sharing and reporting during health emergencies. These obligations must be aligned with the proprietary rights and duties outlined in Section 10\.

*Using health data in the public interest (section 11\)*

The Instrument’s provisions may intersect with the use of health data in the public interest, especially during pandemics and health emergencies where access to critical health data may be necessary. The Health Data Court may need to consider the provisions of the Instrument when adjudicating public interest use-licenses.

*Interoperability standards (section 13\)*

The Instrument may include specific requirements for the interoperability of health data systems during health emergencies. These requirements must be aligned with the interoperability standards determined by the Regulator to ensure seamless data exchange and coordination during crises.

#### **Developing directives and guidelines**

The Regulator is tasked with developing directives and guidelines to ensure the effective implementation of the Instrument’s provisions as they relate to health data management during pandemics and other health emergencies. These directives and guidelines will translate the broad principles of the Instrument into specific, actionable policies that can be applied within the relevant country. Below are important considerations for the Regulator in developing directives and guidelines:

*Reference documents*

The Regulator should refer to international standards and best practices in pandemic response, such as the WHO guidelines on data management during health emergencies. Additionally, the Regulator may consider existing national frameworks that have proven effective in managing previous health crises, adapting them to meet the requirements of the Instrument.

*Stakeholder engagement*

In developing these directives and guidelines, it is crucial to engage with key stakeholders, including public health authorities, healthcare providers, data protection agencies, and civil society organizations. Their input will help ensure that the directives are practical, context-specific, and have broad support.

*Ensuring compliance*

The guidelines should include clear procedures for ensuring compliance with the Instrument’s provisions, including mechanisms for monitoring and reporting, as well as penalties for non-compliance. This will help maintain the integrity of the health data management system during emergencies.

*Interoperability*

One of the critical aspects of the guidelines should be ensuring that health data systems are interoperable, as required by the Instrument. The Regulator should establish specific standards that align with both the Instrument and existing national interoperability frameworks, ensuring seamless data exchange during emergencies.

*Adaptability*

The directives and guidelines should be adaptable to changing circumstances, such as new pandemics or technological advancements. The Regulator should establish a process for regularly reviewing and updating these guidelines to ensure they remain relevant and effective in addressing emerging challenges.

#### **International considerations**

The incorporation of the Instrument into domestic law is dependent on the existing framework of international health law, particularly the IHR of 2005, which is a legally binding agreement under the WHO. The IHR provides the foundational structure for global health security, including requirements for disease surveillance, reporting, and response. The implementation of the Instrument will need to be harmonized with the IHR, ensuring that any new obligations or guidelines do not conflict with or duplicate existing commitments. International standards, such as those developed in the context of the WHO’s PIP Framework or other WHO guidelines, would need to be integrated into domestic law. This ensures that national legislation is consistent with global best practices for managing pandemics and other health emergencies. In addition, this section is dependent on existing global health security agreements, such as those under the GHSA, which includes commitments by countries to strengthen their capacities to prevent, detect, and respond to infectious disease threats. National pandemic preparedness plans, which are often developed in line with WHO guidelines, would also be directly influenced by the Instrument, introducing new obligations for resource allocation, reporting, and coordination that need to be reflected in national plans. A country must ensure that its domestic implementation of the Instrument does not conflict with its obligations under agreements like the TRIPS Agreement (especially regarding access to medicines) or the Universal Declaration of Human Rights (especially regarding the right to health). 

#### **Implementation tips**

Although the Covid-19 pandemic was a terrible event, it did provide valuable evidence of the lack of preparation of many countries to be able to respond appropriately to emergency events. Before this section is put into effect, significant work will be required to ensure that the response by the country to a health emergency is: 

*  Able to be integrated internationally with other countries,   
*  Consistent with any international obligations (such as treaties),   
*  Has been developed in close consultation with healthcare providers and other stakeholders, in particular with disaster management teams,  
*  Is consistent or compatible with existing disaster management and emergency laws,   
*  Is able to be implemented quickly in order to make the interventions effective.


### **Section 13: Emerging Technologies** 

This section of the model law addresses the integration and regulation of emerging technologies in healthcare, focusing on safeguarding the rights of individuals and communities whose health data is collected, processed, or used by such technologies. As healthcare increasingly relies on advanced technologies such as artificial intelligence, machine learning, and big data analytics, it is imperative to ensure that these technologies are deployed in a manner that respects privacy, promotes equity, mitigates bias, and maintains transparency.

The section emphasises the need for individuals and communities to be fully informed about how their health data will be used in emerging technologies, ensuring that they can provide informed consent. Additionally, it sets out requirements for transparency and bias mitigation in the development and application of these technologies. The role of the Regulator is also highlighted, focusing on enforcing compliance with these requirements and collaborating with industry stakeholders to develop guidelines and best practices for scaling technologies in a way that does not compromise security or ethical standards.

#### **Rationale**

*Informed consent in emerging technologies*

This provision ensures that individuals and communities are provided with clear, understandable information about the collection, processing, and use of their health data in emerging technologies. The requirement for informed consent aligns with the broader principle of autonomy and the right to control one’s personal health data. In the context of emerging technologies, where the complexities of data processing can be difficult to understand, providing clear information is essential for enabling informed decision-making. This provision protects individuals and communities from potential misuse of their data and ensures that consent is genuinely informed.

*Transparency and bias mitigation in emerging technologies*

This clause mandates that all emerging technologies used in healthcare adhere to standards of transparency and undergo rigorous evaluation to identify and mitigate biases. Transparency involves making the underlying algorithms comprehensible to relevant stakeholders, while bias mitigation ensures that the technologies do not perpetuate or exacerbate healthcare disparities. Transparency is crucial for building trust in emerging technologies, particularly in healthcare, where decisions made by algorithms can have significant impacts on patient outcomes. By requiring that these technologies be understandable, and their limitations disclosed, the law ensures that stakeholders can make informed assessments of their use. Bias mitigation is equally important to prevent systemic inequalities from being embedded in technological solutions, thereby promoting equitable healthcare outcomes.

*Regulatory oversight and industry collaboration*

This provision empowers the Regulator to enforce compliance with the transparency, bias mitigation, and informed consent requirements. It also mandates the Regulator to collaborate with industry stakeholders to develop guidelines and best practices for the responsible scaling of emerging technologies in healthcare. Regulatory oversight is essential for ensuring that emerging technologies are used responsibly and ethically. By authorising regular audits and assessments, the Regulator can monitor adherence to the law’s standards and hold developers accountable. Collaboration with industry stakeholders is crucial for developing practical guidelines that balance innovation with the need for robust data security and ethical considerations.

#### **Other options of formulating the section**

*Enhanced public disclosure requirements*

The section could include a requirement for public disclosure of the results of algorithm audits and bias mitigation efforts. This would enhance transparency and allow the public to hold technology developers accountable for their impact on healthcare.

*Incentives for ethical innovation*

The law could provide incentives, such as grants or tax breaks, for companies that demonstrate a commitment to transparency, bias mitigation, and informed consent in their development of emerging technologies. This approach would encourage ethical innovation in the healthcare technology sector.

*Creation of an independent oversight body*

Instead of placing all oversight responsibilities on the Regulator, this section could establish an independent body dedicated to monitoring the use of emerging technologies in healthcare. This body could have a multidisciplinary team of experts to evaluate the ethical and technical aspects of these technologies.

#### **Notes on interaction with other sections**

*Health Data Court (section 6\)*

Disputes related to the transparency, bias, or consent issues in emerging technologies may fall under the jurisdiction of the Health Data Court. The Court’s role in adjudicating such matters ensures that the legal protections established by this section are effectively enforced.

*Individual rights; portability of electronic medical records (section 7\)*

The informed consent requirements in this section align with the individual rights established in section 7, particularly the right to control personal health data. Both sections emphasise the importance of clear, understandable communication about how health data is used.

*Prohibition on re-identification (section 8\)*

The transparency and bias mitigation requirements for emerging technologies are supported by the prohibition on re-identification in Section 8\. Ensuring that health data cannot be re-identified without consent reinforces the ethical use of emerging technologies.

*Subsidiary legislation and guidelines (section 17\)*

The development of guidelines and best practices for scaling emerging technologies will likely be detailed in subsidiary legislation. The adaptability of these guidelines to emerging needs and technologies will be crucial for the long-term effectiveness of this section.

#### **Developing guidelines and best practices**

*Reference documents*

The Regulator should consult specific international standards and frameworks, such as:

* *OECD AI Principles*: These principles provide guidance on the responsible development and use of artificial intelligence, emphasising transparency, fairness, and accountability.  
* *WHO Guidelines on Digital Health*: These guidelines offer a comprehensive framework for the integration of digital health technologies, with a focus on equity, ethics, and data protection.  
* *ISO/IEC 27001 and ISO/IEC 27701*: These international standards provide guidelines for information security management and privacy information management, ensuring that emerging technologies are aligned with global best practices in data security.

*Stakeholder engagement*

In developing these guidelines, it is essential to engage with a broad range of stakeholders, including technology developers, healthcare providers, patient advocacy groups, and data protection experts. Their input will help ensure that the guidelines are both practical and reflective of diverse perspectives.

*Continuous monitoring and adaptability*

The guidelines should include mechanisms for continuous monitoring and regular updates to address new challenges and opportunities presented by technological advancements. This will ensure that the law remains relevant and effective in a rapidly evolving field.

*Focus on interoperability and data security*

The guidelines should emphasize the importance of interoperability and data security, ensuring that emerging technologies can integrate seamlessly with existing healthcare systems without compromising data protection principles.

#### **International considerations**

The section’s emphasis on safeguarding the rights of individuals and communities, particularly concerning the collection, processing, and use of health data, is directly dependent on existing international data protection frameworks. International organisations like the OECD and UNESCO have developed AI principles and guidelines that emphasise ethical AI use, fairness, accountability, and transparency. WHO also provides guidance on AI in healthcare. The UDHR and the ICCPR provide a foundation for protecting individual rights, including privacy, autonomy, and the right to informed consent. The section’s alignment with these international human rights standards is crucial, as it ensures that the use of emerging technologies does not infringe on fundamental rights. The use of health data by emerging technologies often involves cross-border data flows, which are regulated by international trade agreements and treaties. For example, agreements such as the US-Mexico-Canada Agreement (USMCA) and the EU’s data transfer agreements set out rules for the cross-border transfer of data, including health data. Ensuring compliance with these agreements is essential for maintaining lawful data flows and avoiding trade barriers. The European Commission’s Ethics Guidelines for Trustworthy AI and similar frameworks from the IEEE or the World Economic Forum outline best practices for the ethical use of AI. International collaborations, such as those facilitated by the WHO, the International Medical Device Regulators Forum (IMDRF), or the Global Harmonisation Task Force (GHTF), aim to harmonise regulations across countries to ensure the safe and effective use of medical technologies. These efforts are crucial for developing coherent and globally recognised regulatory standards. In addition, international treaties such as the TRIPS Agreement could influence how intellectual property rights are managed in the context of emerging technologies. This includes the protection of algorithms, software, and databases that are integral to AI and machine learning in healthcare. Lastly, frameworks like the NIST Cybersecurity Framework (used internationally) and ISO/IEC 27001 standards provide guidelines for securing information systems. Adhering to these standards is critical for protecting health data from breaches and cyberattacks, particularly when technologies involve sensitive health information.

#### **Implementation tips**

This section is closely connected with any law regulating the implementation of Artificial Intelligence (AI) and care must be taken to integrate this section with the AI law. In addition human capacity to: 

* Identify emerging technologies,   
* Draft proposed regulations,   
* Consult with industry stakeholders,   
* Develop guidelines and best practices 

must be developed. These functions would normally be embodied in public / private partnership where representatives of the healthcare industry, the state and relevant stake bodies meet on a regular basis to create and review regulations relating to emerging technologies. 

### **Section 14: Feedback, Confidentiality, and Protection of Whistle-Blowers** 

This section establishes critical protections and mechanisms for reporting illegal or unethical use of health data, unauthorized re-identification, and other concerns related to the model law. By ensuring that individuals can report such issues confidentially and without fear of retaliation, this section upholds the integrity of health data governance and promotes accountability among those who handle health data.

#### **Rationale**

*Functional reporting mechanism*

This provision mandates that the Regulator establishes and maintains a functional reporting mechanism that allows individuals to report illegal or unethical use of health data, unauthorised re-identification, and other issues related to the model law. A well-functioning reporting mechanism is essential for detecting and addressing violations of the law. It enables individuals to play an active role in safeguarding the ethical use of health data, thereby enhancing the overall governance framework. By allowing feedback on problems or omissions in the model law, this provision also supports continuous improvement of the legal framework.

*Confidentiality of reports*

This clause ensures that any report of unethical or illegal health data practices to the Regulator remains strictly confidential. The identity of the person(s) who provided the report can only be disclosed with their express consent or as directed by the Health Data Court or a court of law. Confidentiality is crucial for protecting individuals who come forward with information about unethical or illegal practices. It encourages whistle-blowers to report violations without fear of exposure or retaliation, thereby enabling the Regulator to effectively address and rectify such issues.

*Protection of whistle-blowers*

This provision prohibits data controllers from discriminating against any person who reports illegal or unethical health data practices. It ensures that whistle-blowers are protected from disciplinary actions or other forms of retaliation. Protecting whistle-blowers is essential for fostering a culture of accountability and ethical behavior within organisations that handle health data. By safeguarding whistle-blowers from retaliation, this provision encourages individuals to report wrongdoing, thereby helping to maintain the integrity of health data governance.

#### **Other options of formulating the section**

*Anonymous reporting option*

The section could include provisions for anonymous reporting, allowing individuals to report unethical or illegal practices without revealing their identity at all. This could further encourage reporting by providing an additional layer of protection.

*Mandatory whistle-blower training*

The law could require organisations to provide regular training on whistle-blower protections and the reporting process. This would ensure that all employees are aware of their rights and the mechanisms available to them for reporting unethical practices.

*Incentives for whistle-blowers*

The section could include provisions for providing incentives, such as financial rewards, for whistle-blowers who report significant violations that lead to corrective actions. This approach could further motivate individuals to come forward with important information.

#### **Notes on interaction with other sections**

*Health Data Court (section 6\)*

The Health Data Court’s role in potentially ordering the disclosure of a whistle-blower’s identity interacts with this section’s confidentiality provisions. The Court must balance the need for confidentiality with the legal requirements for transparency and justice in specific cases.

*Prohibition on re-identification (section 8\)*

Reports related to unauthorised re-identification of health data are directly linked to this section. The protections for whistle-blowers are crucial for encouraging the reporting of such serious violations, ensuring that the prohibition on re-identification is enforced effectively.

*Emerging technologies (section 13\)*

As emerging technologies are increasingly integrated into healthcare, the potential for unethical use of health data may grow. This section’s protections will be crucial for ensuring that issues related to the use of emerging technologies are reported and addressed promptly.

*Offences and penalties (sections 15 and 16\)*

The protection of whistle-blowers from retaliation aligns with the penalties for unethical or illegal practices outlined in the offences and penalties sections. Ensuring that those who report violations are protected strengthens the enforcement of these penalties and upholds the rule of law.

#### **Notes on Reporting Mechanisms**

*Accessibility*

Reporting mechanisms should be easily accessible to all potential reporters, including those with disabilities or those who may not have advanced technical skills. This may involve providing multiple reporting channels, such as hotlines, online forms, and physical submission options.

*Clear guidance*

The Regulator should provide clear and simple instructions on how to report issues, what information is required, and what protections are in place for those who report. This helps ensure that individuals are fully informed about the process and their rights.

*Anonymity options*

While confidentiality is crucial, offering the option to report anonymously can provide additional reassurance to individuals who fear retaliation. However, reporters should be made aware of the potential limitations of anonymity, such as challenges in follow-up investigations.

*Timely acknowledgment and response*

It is important that the Regulator acknowledges receipt of reports promptly and provides updates on the status of the report. This builds trust in the reporting system and reassures individuals that their concerns are being taken seriously.

*Data security*

The reporting mechanism must incorporate robust data security measures to protect the confidentiality and integrity of the information submitted. This includes secure storage of reports, encryption of digital submissions, and controlled access to sensitive information.

*Feedback loop*

Establishing a feedback loop where reporters are informed about the outcomes of their reports (where appropriate) can enhance transparency and trust in the system. This also demonstrates the effectiveness of the reporting mechanism.

*Training and awareness*

Regular training for both potential reporters and those managing the reporting mechanisms is essential. Reporters should be aware of their rights and protections, while those managing the system need to handle reports with sensitivity and confidentiality.

*Regular audits*

The reporting mechanism itself should be subject to regular audits to ensure it is functioning effectively and securely. These audits can help identify any weaknesses or areas for improvement, ensuring the system remains reliable and trustworthy.

#### **International considerations**

International agreements such as the United Nations Convention against Corruption (UNCAC) and the OECD’s guidelines for whistleblower protection provide a basis for safeguarding individuals who expose wrongdoing. These frameworks emphasise the need for confidentiality, protection against retaliation, and legal recourse for whistleblowers. Domestic laws implementing this section would need to align with these international standards to ensure effective protection and encourage reporting. The UDHR and the ICCPR emphasise the right to freedom of expression and protection against unjust treatment. This section would need to align with these principles to ensure that individuals who report abuses are not subject to retaliation or discrimination. The IHR      emphasise the importance of transparency and timely reporting of public health risks, which can include whistleblower reports on the misuse of health data during a pandemic. Compliance with IHR and other WHO guidelines may be necessary to ensure that whistleblower protections are adequately integrated into public health frameworks. Guidelines from bodies such as the OECD or the International Organisation for Standardisation (ISO), particularly ISO 37002 on whistleblowing management systems, provide standards for creating effective and confidential reporting mechanisms within organisations. Aligning with these guidelines ensures that the section’s provisions for feedback and whistleblower protection are robust and globally recognised. In addition, initiatives such as Transparency International’s anti-corruption frameworks or the UNCAC’s anti-corruption measures underscore the importance of protecting whistleblowers as a means to prevent and combat corruption. Lastly, international Labour Organisation (ILO) conventions on workplace safety and the protection of workers’ rights can influence the extent to which whistleblower protections are implemented in the healthcare sector. 

#### **Implementation tips**

The section presupposes that funds are available for the creation of an anonymous reporting mechanism which is capable of directing whistleblower information to the correct recipients by the Regulator without compromising the anonymity of the whistleblower. It is recommended that a business plan be created for this service which would include its financial sustainability and ensure its secure but anonymous communication to state organisations such as the office of public prosecutions. 

#### Part B3: Criminal offences and general provisions

### **Section 15: Offences** 

This section outlines specific acts or omissions that are subject to criminal sanctions. To ensure responsible handling of health data and protect it from misuse, the law classifies certain actions or omissions as criminal offences, thereby promoting a high level of compliance. Anyone who engages in these prohibited acts or fails to act as required is deemed guilty of an offence, which triggers the corresponding criminal penalties specified in the model law. This provision ensures that the model law is not merely a symbolic declaration of rights and duties but is reinforced with appropriate sanctions to ensure adherence to its provisions. Moreover, this section aligns with international principles of criminal law, which stipulate that only those acts explicitly defined in written law, along with their corresponding penalties, can be recognised as punishable offences.

#### **Rationale**

*Unauthorised access or disclosure*

This offence occurs when someone intentionally accesses or shares health data without permission or goes beyond what the data subject has consented to. For example, where a hospital employee accesses a patient's medical records out of curiosity, without the patient’s consent or a valid justification, this is unauthorised access. If they then share this information with someone else, it's unauthorised disclosure.

*Gross failure to protect health data*

This involves a significant lapse in implementing security measures, characterised by recklessness or negligence, resulting in the unauthorized access, loss, or alteration of health data. For example, if a healthcare organisation fails to properly encrypt its digital health records, allowing hackers to easily access and alter patient data, this would be considered a gross failure to protect health data.

*Misuse of data*

This offence involves using health data for purposes other than what the person or community consented to, or for reasons not allowed by law, like unauthorised selling of data or profiling. For example, where a company uses patient health data to target them with ads for expensive medical products without the patients’ consent or where a health care service provider sells patients data to advertisers without consent, this is a misuse of data.

*Non-compliance with access rights*

Where a data controller fails or refuses to provide individuals with access to their health data or not correcting or deleting data as requested and required by law, then an offence has been committed under the model law. For example, where a patient requests to see their health records to correct a mistake, and the hospital refuses or delays without a valid reason, this amounts to non-compliance with access rights.

*Failure to provide health data on demand by Health Data Court*

A failure to comply with the order or directives of the Health Data Court to provide when instructed to do so is an offence in the model law. An example is where a healthcare provider is ordered by the Health Data Court to hand over patient records for an investigation and they refuse, this would be an offence in the model law. This offence aims to protect the authority and jurisdiction of the Health Data Court.

*Obstruction of oversight*

A deliberate interference or obstruction of the work of the Regulator or Health Data Court is an offence in the model law. Furthermore, failure to comply with the lawful request for information of the Health Data Court or regulator during audits or investigations is an offence. For example, where a company hides evidence during an audit or investigation, this amounts to an offence of obstruction of oversight.

*Falsification of data*

Intentionally altering, falsifying or destroying health records in order to deceive or mislead regulatory authorities or data subjects is an offence in the model law. There are several instances where this offence could occur. For example, a researcher fabricating clinical trial results to obtain approval for a drug or where a clinic alters a patients record to cover up a negligence by medical personnel.

*Failure to report breaches*

Not reporting a data breach to the Health Data Court and the affected individuals as required by the model law is punishable. For example**,** a where a health service provider’s database or cloud is hacked and the breach is not reported to the authorities or the affected patients within the required timeframe, this is a failure to report breaches.

*Re-identification of health data*

It is an offence for a person who obtains, possess or has access to anonymised or pseudonymised personal health data to *intentionally* re-identify or attempt to re-identify such data. For example, where a pharmaceutical company receives anonymised data to study the efficacy of a new drug, they must not and cannot try to find out who the individual patients are, as doing so would violate their privacy rights and breach the model law.

#### **Other options of formulating the section**

*Categorisation of offences*

The law could categorise the offences into groups to aid implementation and make imposition of the penalties easier. For example, data protection and security offences such as unauthorised access, gross failure to protect data and misuse of data may be separated from regulatory compliance and obstruction offences such as obstruction of oversight and falsification of data. Similarly, the law may provide a hierarchical structure for offences whereby most severe offences such as unauthorised access and data misuse are separated from less severe ones such as failure to report breaches.

*Aligning with offences in national data protection law*

An alternative approach especially for countries who may not chose the option of direct adoption of the model law is to align the offences and punishment with those under the national data protection law. This is a viable option especially for those offences which are similar to generally known offence under data protection law such as misuse of data.

*Creation of more offences*

The law of countries could also establish more offences which are not provided under the model law for conducts that may lead to harm to data subjects in the processing of their data.

*Proactive measures*

The law could also harness other proactive and less punitive measures to prevent violations before the actually occur. Such measure includes regular audits, effective warning system etc.

#### **Notes on interaction with other sections**

*Scope (Section 3\)*

The section on offences interacts with section 3 which outlines the scope of the law by providing clarity on potential violators of the law. Thus ‘individuals and entities involved in the collection, generation, processing, storage, use, access, sharing and disposal of health data and health-related data’ are those who are most likely to be liable for offences under the law. Besides, the offences created under the law are applicable in the course of processing of health data within a country or by data controllers located outside the country where the data pertains to individuals and/or communities within the country.

*Exclusions (section 4\)*

There is no offence for acts or omission in the course of processing of personal data where the model law does not apply. For example, acts or omission that will otherwise constitute an offence will not be so where the processing of health data is for personal or household activities or where the health data is required by a public body under the exclusion section of the law.

*Health Data Court (section 6\)*

The provision on offences is to be used by the Health Data Court established in section 6 to ‘make determinations, order remedial actions and impose penalties’ necessary to enforce the provisions of the model law. Failure to comply with the orders and decisions of the health data court is an offence defined under this section and punishable under section 16\.

*Prohibition on re-identification (section 8\)*

This provision reinforces the prohibition on re-identification showing the magnitude of such act to the rights of data subjects. The criminalisation of this act also helps promote health research and re-use of data without the need to comply with copious provisions of data protection law. In other words, the offence of re-identifying health data (Section 15.i) is linked to the protections against re-identification outlined in Section 8, reinforcing the importance of maintaining data anonymity.

#### **International considerations**

International treaties like the Rome Statute of the International Criminal Court and various United Nations conventions, such as the UN Convention against Transnational Organised Crime, provide overarching principles of criminal law that could influence how offenses related to health data are defined and prosecuted. If health data misuse during a pandemic or other health emergency leads to international consequences, the model law’s provisions should be aligned with IHR obligations. This includes ensuring that criminal offenses related to health data breaches during pandemics are consistent with the IHR’s requirements for transparency, reporting, and data handling. International frameworks like the Budapest Convention on Cybercrime, the ISO/IEC 27000 family of standards for information security management, and other cybersecurity treaties provide guidelines for what constitutes cyber offenses, including unauthorised data access and breaches. Aligning the model law with these standards ensures that offenses related to the integrity and security of health data are clearly defined and enforceable internationally. The enforcement of criminal sanctions for offenses related to health data misuse may depend on existing international treaties and agreements on legal cooperation and extradition. Treaties such as the European Convention on Extradition and various bilateral agreements between countries facilitate the cross-border enforcement of criminal sanctions. The model law’s criminal provisions must be compatible with these treaties to ensure that offenders can be prosecuted, even if they are in another jurisdiction. Agreements under initiatives like the Global Health Security Agenda (GHSA) may include provisions for the secure handling of health data to prevent public health risks. Criminalising the misuse of health data in alignment with these agreements helps ensure global public health security. Lastly, international intellectual property agreements, such as the TRIPS Agreement, may also influence how offenses related to the unauthorised use of proprietary health data are defined and prosecuted. 

#### **Implementation tips**

It is recommended that a sentencing and penalties guideline be developed to assist the courts – rather than dictate \- with the appropriate sentence / penalty would be for the commission of these offences. 

### **Section 16: Penalties** 

This section establishes a framework for penalizing the offences identified in the preceding section thereby ensuring that breaches are addressed through a range of possible sanctions. A law is considered incomplete if it merely defines an offence without specifying the corresponding punishment. By providing clear penalties, this section ensures that the enforcement and prosecution of offences under the law are both just and legally sound. Additionally, it promotes certainty in the application of the provision of the model law.

#### **Rationale**

*Penalty for offences*

The section provides a wide range of enforcement options or penalties for individuals found guilty of offences mentioned in section 15\. Accordingly, such individuals or data controllers *may* be liable to fines, corrective actions, suspension or revocation of licences and criminal prosecution. It needs to be pointed out that this list of penalties is not exhaustive, and law could impose other penalties. Therefore, if a data controller is found guilty of unauthorised access to patient health data (Section 15(a)), it may face a fine, be required to implement new security measures (corrective action) and could have its license to operate temporarily suspended. In severe cases, the responsible individuals might also face criminal sanctions. 

*Determining the severity of penalties*

The model law provides guidelines for determining the severity of penalties, which is essential given the wide range of enforcement actions available to authorities. This section serves as a framework for assessing the appropriate penalty by considering factors such as the nature of the offence, the harm caused, the offender's intent, and their compliance history. The goal is to ensure that penalties are proportionate and fair. Thus, where a pharmaceutical company intentionally misuses health data for unauthorised commercial purposes (Section 15(c)), causing significant harm to individuals, the penalties will be more severe compared to a minor, unintentional breach by a small clinic with no prior compliance issues. The company might face a higher fine, stricter corrective actions, and potential criminal charges for intentional misconduct.

*Specific penalties*

The model law further provides for penalties, including the amount of fines and the duration of imprisonment, for specific offences – when, and if convicted of such offences. It provides clear guidelines on the legal consequences of breaches and allows for customisation based on the specific subsection of Section 15 that was violated. This section ensures transparency and consistency in the application of penalties, making it clear what the consequences are for particular offences.

#### **Other options of formulating the section**

*Restorative justice option*

When implementing this provision, a country could incorporate restorative justice measures, such as requiring offenders to compensate victims for harm caused by data breaches. This approach acknowledges that penalties alone may not fully address the complexities of health data violations across different contexts.

*Specific penalty regime*

Countries could also consider introducing specific penalties for each of the offences created under the model law. This may allow for more certainty and less discretion in imposition of sanction by the Health Data Court or Regulator.

*Conditional penalties with remedial actions* 

Regulators may also consider introducing conditional penalties that are contingent upon the offender’s completion of specific remedial actions. This allows for corrective action to be taken, potentially avoiding harsher penalties if the offender demonstrates a commitment to compliance. A data controller might avoid a severe penalty if they promptly implement and demonstrate improved data protection measures after a breach.

*Corporate liability and individual accountability distinction option*

In implementing the model law, countries could also consider distinguishing corporate liability and individual accountability so as to ensure that both entities and responsible individuals can be held accountable. This ensures that those in positions of authority who contribute to or knowingly allow breaches are held personally accountable, alongside the entity itself.

#### **Notes on interaction with other sections**

*Prohibition on re-identification (section 8\)*

Section 16 supports the prohibition on re-dentification by ensuring that appropriate penalties are imposed for this breach. This interaction guarantees that entities take these rights seriously and comply with rules on re-identification.

*Health Data Court (section 13\)*

Section 16 provides the Health Data Court with the authority to impose penalties, ensuring that there are legal consequences for violations. This supports the court’s role in enforcing compliance and resolving disputes.

*Offences* *(section 15\)*

Section 16 outlines the penalties for specific offences listed in Section 15, such as unauthorised access or misuse of health data. This ensures that there are clear consequences for each type of offence, promoting adherence to the law.

*Subsidiary legislation (section 17\)*

Section 16 interacts with Section 17 by demonstrating how subsidiary legislation can be used to establish additional offences under the law in response to emerging circumstances.

*All the other provisions of the law*

By integrating penalties and sanctions, Section 16 supports the overall framework of the law, ensuring that all provisions are effectively enforced and that data controllers are motivated to comply with the legal requirements.

#### **International considerations**

International treaties such as the Rome Statute of the International Criminal Court and various United Nations conventions set standards for ensuring that penalties are just, appropriate, and consistent with the severity of the crime. The IHR mandates that member states establish legal frameworks to handle public health risks, including penalties for non-compliance with data reporting and sharing obligations. The model law’s penalties must consider these obligations, particularly if the offenses involve the handling of health data during a global health crisis. The Budapest Convention on Cybercrime and ISO/IEC 27001 standards outline penalties and sanctions for cybersecurity breaches. Aligning the model law’s penalties with these international standards ensures that offenses involving health data are penalised consistently and effectively, particularly in cases involving cross-border cybercrime. The enforcement of penalties, especially in cases involving cross-border offenses, may depend on existing international cooperation and extradition treaties. Treaties such as the European Convention on Extradition and bilateral agreements between countries facilitate the cross-border enforcement of penalties. The model law’s penalties should be structured to ensure they can be enforced in other jurisdictions, in line with these treaties. The GHSA and similar initiatives emphasize the importance of compliance with public health obligations. Penalties under the model law may need to reflect these commitments, particularly in terms of deterring non-compliance during health emergencies. The OECD Guidelines for Multinational Enterprises and similar frameworks outline principles for corporate liability and the imposition of penalties. The model law’s penalties for organisations should align with these standards to ensure that corporations handling health data are held accountable in a manner consistent with international best practices. 

#### **Implementation tips**

It is also worth noting that international experience has demonstrated Regulators have had more success in working with stakeholders to avoid contravening the law – normally by means of a voluntary audit \- than from a widespread implementation of heavy penalties. 

### **Section 17: Subsidiary Legislation** 

Section 17 acknowledges the critical role of subsidiary legislation in the effective implementation of the Model Law, particularly in areas where rapid technological advancements create a dynamic legal landscape. As digital technologies and data processing methods evolve at an unprecedented pace, the static nature of primary legislation may struggle to adequately address emerging issues or provide sufficient detail in specific areas. Subsidiary legislation serves as a vital mechanism to bridge this gap, enabling the law to remain adaptable and responsive to technological developments. By allowing for the creation of detailed regulations and guidelines under the broader framework of the Model Law, section 17 guarantees that the legal infrastructure can evolve in tandem with technological innovation, thereby enhancing the overall effectiveness of data governance in practice. This approach not only strengthens the legal framework but also ensures that the principles enshrined in the Model Law are operationalised in a manner that is both timely and contextually relevant.

#### **Rationale**

*Empowerment of the relevant national authority*

The section empowers the relevant national authority to develop subsidiary legislation under the broader framework of the Model Law or national data protection legislation. This is essential because the primary legislation often cannot anticipate every specific issue that may arise in practice. Subsidiary legislation provides the flexibility to adapt to changing circumstances, ensuring that the law remains effective over time. For example, the relevant national authority may issue specific regulations or guidelines regarding how personal health data should be de-identified during storage or transmission to enhance high-level compliance with the health data principles in the model law.

*Scope of subsidiary legislation*

The section further outlines the general scope of issues that subsidiary legislation may address. The non-exhaustive list of this areas includes data protection standards, individual and community rights, data controller obligations, reporting requirements, audit procedures and penalties for non-compliance. By outlining these areas, the law gives an idea of specific aspects that may need further elucidation in subsidiary instrument to facilitate comprehensive coverage of all aspects of health data governance thereby providing a clear framework for the detailed regulation needed to implement the primary law effectively.

*Objectives of subsidiary legislation*

This section emphasizes that the goals of any subsidiary legislation must align with the broader objectives outlined in Section 1, such as safeguarding privacy, enhancing data security, and promoting ethical data use. This provision fosters consistency and better alignment between the model law and its subsidiary legislation thereby minimizing potential conflicts.

#### **Other options for formulating the section**

*Mandatory consultation and stakeholder engagement*

To make the subsidiary legislation more inclusive and participatory, the law may include a mandatory consultation and stakeholder engagement provision in the law. This will guarantee that the subsidiary legislation is informed by those affected by them. It will also ensure that experts participate in the process to enhance the quality of the subsidiary legislation.

*Publication and accessibility*

Countries may also consider including a provision requiring the publication of the subsidiary legislation to ensure it is accessible to the public. This includes publication in official government or online platforms

*Approval or review mechanism*

There may also be provisions for approval or review of the subsidiary legislation, such as parliamentary oversight. Such legislation may be reviewed by the parliament or other bodies to ensure that the subsidiary legislation aligns with the model law. This body may be a committee of experts or directors of agencies in the Ministry of Health, the Ministry of Justice, or particular bodies of the relevant sector.

*Sunset clauses*

This section may also incorporate sunset clauses which make provisions for the tenure of the legislation. Therefore, the section may include a provision that the subsidiary legislation will expire after a certain period unless renewed by parliament. This is to ensure periodic review and relevance.

*Hierarchy and precedence*

The section may also include a provision clarifying the hierarchy between different types of subsidiary legislation and their relationship with the model law. For example, there may be a provision that regulations may take precedence over guidelines or directives. In addition, implementing nations may consider including a provision on how conflicts between the law and subsidiary legislation may be resolved.

#### **Notes on interaction with other sections**

*Purpose (section 1\)*

Section 17 supports the purpose of the model law, specifically section 1(g), in that a subsidiary legislation could assist in providing a flexible and adaptive legal framework that accommodates future technological advancements in health data processing by ensuring the law remains relevant and effective in a rapidly evolving digital landscape. 

*Definitions (section 2\)*

Subsidiary legislation under Section 17, in its provision for sector specific rules, could also complement the definition section by defining sectorally applicable terminologies that are not contained in the definitions. Similarly, subsidiary legislation could assist in expanding or further clarifying the use of crucial terminologies defined in section 2\.

*Individual rights; portability of electronic medical records (section 7\)*

Section 17 supports the enforcement of data subject rights by enabling the creation of specific regulations that detail the processes for exercising the right to portability of medical records. In addition, section 17 could assist in the actualization of section 7(3), which requires the Regulator to establish standards for interoperability of electronic medical records in guidelines.

*Emerging technologies (section 13\)*

Section 17 will be relevant when implementing section 13(3) which requires the Regulator to collaborate with industry stakeholders to develop guidelines and best practices for scaling emerging healthcare technologies to ensure that scalability solutions do not compromise data security. These guidelines are subsidiary legislation.

*Penalties and enforcement (section 16\)*

Section 17 allows for the developing specific penalties and enforcement mechanisms under Section 16\. This ensures that there are clear consequences for non-compliance, which can be regularly updated to remain effective and relevant.

**International considerations**

In the context of health data, subsidiary legislation may need to be adaptable to align with international health regulations, particularly during pandemics or health emergencies. The IHR and other WHO guidelines require countries to establish legal frameworks that can respond to public health emergencies. The Budapest Convention on Cybercrime, NIST Cybersecurity Framework, and ISO/IEC cybersecurity standards provide guidelines for managing cybersecurity risks, which may need to be reflected in subsidiary legislation. The TRIPS Agreement and WIPO guidelines set out the international standards for IP protection. Subsidiary legislation will need to ensure that any new regulations related to the use of technology and health data respect these international IP norms. If the subsidiary legislation involves cross-border data flow, it will need to align with international trade agreements that govern data transfer and protection. Agreements such as the USMCA, GDPR’s adequacy decisions, and other bilateral trade agreements that involve data sharing and protection could influence the formulation of subsidiary legislation. This ensures that cross-border data transfers under the Model Law comply with international trade obligations. Initiatives like the Global Health Security Agenda (GHSA) emphasize the need for responsive legal frameworks that can quickly adapt to emerging public health threats. Subsidiary legislation may need to align with these initiatives to ensure that health data governance is effective during global health crises. Organisations such as the International Medical Device Regulators Forum (IMDRF) and the OECD provide guidelines for regulatory harmonisation in the healthcare and technology sectors. Subsidiary legislation should align with these guidelines to ensure that the Model Law’s provisions are consistent with international best practices and facilitate international cooperation. 

#### **Implementation tips**

Several of the above sections require regulations / guidelines / standards to be developed which should only be done if a clear plan to consult with all stakeholders has been developed. 

### **Section 18: Review** 

This section guarantees that the law remains not only relevant and effective but also adaptable and responsive to technological advancements and societal changes over time, thereby maintaining its efficacy in an evolving landscape. 

#### **Rationale**

*Impact assessment*

To identify existing problems and changes in technology, law, or society that affect health data governance, the section allows the Regulator to initiate an impact assessment of the law at any time. The impact assessment should, however, be mandatory after a specified period of time.

*Modifications*

The impact assessment to be delivered to the relevant national authority or the Regulator will include recommended modifications to the law, including additions, amendments, and deletions.

Generally, this section has the following practical relevance

* Continuous improvement: Regular impact assessments allow for the identification of existing problems and areas for improvement. This ensures that the law evolves and improves continuously, addressing any issues that may arise in its implementation.  
* Adaptation to change: The field of health data governance is dynamic, with frequent technological, legal, and societal changes. Mandatory periodic reviews ensure that the law keeps pace with these changes, adapting to new developments and emerging challenges.  
* Evidence-based policy making: Impact assessments provide evidence-based insights into how the law is functioning. This data-driven approach helps make informed decisions about necessary amendments, ensuring that changes to the law are based on solid evidence and real-world impact.  
* Proactive governance: Allowing the regulator to initiate impact assessments at any time provides a proactive approach to governance. This flexibility ensures that the law can be reviewed and updated in response to urgent issues or significant changes rather than waiting for the mandatory review period.  
* Comprehensive evaluation: The impact assessment includes recommendations for additions, amendments, and deletions. This comprehensive evaluation ensures that all aspects of the law are considered, and necessary changes are made to enhance its effectiveness and relevance.

#### **Other options of formulating the section**

*Phased reviews*

The law could provide that the impact assessment be conducted in stages while focusing on specific areas during each phase and then a comprehensive review at set intervals.

*Stakeholder involvement*

The law may also include the participation of stakeholders as part of the impact assessment process to ensure the diversity of perspectives.

#### **Notes on interaction with another section**

*Emerging technologies (Section 13\)*

Section 18 interacts with section 13 by guaranteeing that the standards regarding emerging technologies remain updated and aligned with international best practices on health data protection. 

#### **International considerations** 

Review is highly dependent on various international frameworks, including pandemic preparedness agreements (e.g., IHR, GHSA), data protection regulations (e.g., GDPR), intellectual property treaties (e.g., TRIPS), WHO guidelines, and cross-border data-sharing agreements (e.g., USMCA, OECD Guidelines). Regular reviews ensure that the law remains aligned with these evolving international standards, maintaining its relevance and effectiveness in a globalised and rapidly changing health data governance landscape.

#### **Implementation tips**

The review of the impact of legislation is often a standard function of the executive. If this process already exists within the country, this requirement should be integrated into the existing review process. 

### **Section 19: Transitional Provisions** 

This section is designed to ensure that any amendments to the law are implemented in a manner that minimizes disruption for all stakeholders, including data controllers, individuals, and communities. It provides comprehensive legal guidance and establishes clear processes for managing the transition from the existing legal framework to the newly established regime. By doing so, it aims to facilitate compliance and protect the rights and interests of those impacted by the legal changes. Additionally, this section is crafted to prevent any legal or procedural gaps from arising during the transition, thereby ensuring a seamless shift from the old to the new legal order.

#### **Rationale**

*Transitional provisions*

The inclusion of transitional provisions in amendment legislation is crucial for managing the practical implications of legal changes. Without such provisions, sudden shifts in legal requirements could lead to confusion, non-compliance, or unintended negative consequences for stakeholders. This subsection establishes a clear and structured process for transitioning to the new legal framework, which helps avoid legal and operational uncertainties. It reflects the understanding that stakeholders need time and guidance to adapt to new rules, especially in complex areas like health data governance. For example, where an amendment introduces new requirements for data controllers to implement advanced encryption standards, there may be a need for a provision allowing some time for data controllers to comply before they can be held in breach.

*Grace Periods, Phased Implementation, and Continuation of Practices*

The section also provides a non-exhaustive list of examples of transnational provisions:

*Grace periods for compliance*: Grace periods allow stakeholders, particularly data controllers, to adjust their practices and systems to comply with new legal requirements without facing immediate penalties. This is especially important in sectors involving sensitive data, where sudden changes could disrupt services or operations. Grace periods provide a buffer time, ensuring stakeholders have adequate time to understand and implement the changes.

*Phased implementation schedules*: Phased implementation allows for gradual adoption of the new requirements, which can be particularly useful when the amendments involve complex changes. This approach prevents overwhelming stakeholders with simultaneous demands and allows them to prioritize the most critical aspects of compliance first. It also enables regulators to monitor the implementation process and address any issues that arise incrementally.

*Continuation of certain practices*: This provision allows for the continuation of existing practices under specific conditions, which might be necessary in cases where an immediate shift to new practices is impractical or could lead to significant disruptions. It also allows for a more nuanced approach, where some old practices can continue temporarily while new practices are being phased in, thus ensuring that the transition is as smooth as possible.

#### **Other options of formulating the section**

*Tiered compliance timelines*

This approach provides a grace period while also requiring regular updates to be provided to the Regulator, which helps the Regulator monitor progress and address potential issues early.

*Phased implementation by function*

Another option that may be considered is the phased implementation by function option, which allows data controllers to prioritize the most critical aspects of the new requirements, thereby reducing the burden of simultaneous compliance.

*Conditional continuation of practices*

This option permits existing practices to continue temporarily, provided they meet certain conditions that mitigate risks, thereby ensuring ongoing protection of health data.

#### **Notes on interaction with another section**

*Review (section 18\)*

Section 19 interacts with section 18 by providing options for managing data processing activities where the outcome/recommendation of impact assessment is amendment of the law.

#### **International considerations** 

Transitional Provisions is dependent on various international regulations, agreements, and guidelines. These include pandemic preparedness frameworks (e.g., IHR, PIP Framework), data protection laws (e.g., GDPR), cross-border data-sharing agreements (e.g., USMCA, OECD Guidelines), intellectual property treaties (e.g., TRIPS), and human rights frameworks (e.g., UDHR, ICCPR). Aligning the transitional provisions with these international frameworks ensures that the law remains compliant and that the shift from the old to the new legal framework is smooth, safeguarding individual rights, proprietary interests, and public health objectives during the process.

#### **Implementation tips**

The review of the impact of legislation is often a standard function of the executive. If this process already exists within the country, this requirement should be integrated into the existing review process. 

### **Section 20: Short Title and Commencement**  

This section establishes a clear and formal identification of the law and outlines when it will take effect. The section serves several useful purposes including clarity, legal formality and legal basis/legitimacy.

#### **Rationale**

*Short title*

The purpose of the sub-section is to provide the official name of the law. A clear and descriptive title is essential for legal documents and law. It allows for easy reference during legal dispute resolution in court or arbitration, discussions, legal texts, and academic work. The title encapsulates the law's focus on health data governance, informing stakeholders about its primary subject matter.

*Commencement*

Establishing a commencement date provides clarity regarding when the provisions of the law will be enforceable. It allows stakeholders to prepare for compliance and ensures that there is a formal process for the implementation of the law. The requirement for authorization by the head of state adds a layer of governmental oversight, reinforcing the law's authority and ensuring that it is aligned with national policies and priorities.

#### **Other options of formulating the section**

*Inclusion of transitional provision*

Rather than have a standalone transitional provision, the (sub)section on commencement may include a transitional provision, thereby acknowledging the need for a structured approach to implementation of the law allowing for a smoother transition.

*Delegation of authority for commencement*

Another option is that the section of the law may delegate the authority to determine the commencement date to a relevant body other than the head of state of the country, such as the Minister. This approach allows for flexibility in implementation based on readiness and operational considerations.

*Explicit reference to related laws*

The section may also explicitly mention that it complements existing data protection laws and shall be implemented with them. By explicitly mentioning them in this section, the option clarifies the relationship between the new law and existing legal frameworks, thereby promoting coherence and reducing legal conflicts
